# Hi, and welcome to the the 1992 Pidgin and Creole hypertext. 

This was work I did for my linguistics field in my PhD program. My theoretical linguistics advisor refused to look at it because it was not printed, the sociolinguisitcs advisor thought I was playing for the other team because of mixing and theoretical linguistics and sociolinguistics. I lkearned much about boundary peeing and such.  Submitting a program instead of a paper was rude in 1992, but it all worked put anyway.  

It is disorganized in a 1992 hypertexty way, but you will find that it loads pages instantly when you execute a link.  That means you can shuttle back and forth and execute new jumps without paying the speed toll that the modern web charges to do anything.  I discuss this in my medium essay [here](https://medium.com/@rich.rath/chromes-link-to-highlight-wait-don-t-go-just-yet-4bb6c7c88cea).

Functional set notation takes roughly the following form:
{AAA bbb [{CCC} {DDD}]}
Roughly:
_CCC performs the bbb function of form AAA on DDD_

Where CCC is a form of function bbb that takes two arguments, CCC and DDD.

So, A one-argument clause,
_She left_
becomes
{LEFT do [She]}

A two argument clause,
_John hits the ball_
becomes
{HIT do [John, ball]}

And a three argument clause,
_It gives her the creeps_
becomes
{GIVE do [It, her, the creeps]}
--This is my interpretation of the set notation employed by Ray Jackendoff {<inc> ??}

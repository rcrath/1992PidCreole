**** conclusions re: discrete/generational problem of transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <hist00>

The earliest African immigrants to the Americas and their offspring molded the creole cultural language that subsequent unseasoned African immigrants would have to learn as a second language.  The need for pidginization would only gradually be eliminated as a new syncretic native identity took shape.  However, pidginized varieties, in use as communicative rather than representative languages, would be the languages actually learned, regardless of the target.  In this way, Schuchardt's _vermitlungsprachen_ <schu-pid.com>, a term that Holm criticizes as vague, seems to capture precisely the nature of pidgin languages as opposed to creoles.  
Native-born generations, developing in varying proportions to the total population in different times and places, transformed these interlanguages into full-blown, mature varieties used for representation as well as communication.  Later immigrants would be faced with the task not of making a common language where none existed, but of learning a new language.  Subsequent language-acquirers in such an environment would gradually shift from creating a new creole language to acquiring a mature creole language.  Although, in the aggregate, these processes would shade into each other over time, immigrants learning a second language and a new way of life were discrete from those born into a creole culture, whether newly created or fully developed and changing.  These were different points of view, and the ramifications on language acquisition need to be considered.

**** bioprogram hypothesis, applicability of ___
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.2>

Bioprogram-type constraints would only be applicable under a very narrow window of temporal and social conditions.  From the perspective of an individual, a creole may be formed and acquired once (if at all), after which it is a native language.  As such, it has the same possibilities of transmission to others in a group as does any other language, but with perhaps an increased liklihood of pidginization being one of those processes.  If communally the pidginization process diminishes across generations, perhaps from the cessation of forced immigration, then subsequent language change will tend toward the form of a more homogenous generational transmission of language, submerging unmarked manifestations of the bioprogram in the markings of societal relations, even if the mature language undergoing transmission and change is itself classifiable as a creole.

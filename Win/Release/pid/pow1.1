___Relations defined________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the sake of comparison, consider the _a priori_ definition given for relations:
    R = a reciprocal channel; a path.                <pow01 -6)>

Factoring out power from the definitions of power relations <pow11> yields an interesting general definition of relations:

    Relations are the domain that makes it possible for entities      to interact temporally.                          <pow01 -5)>

Or more succinctly, 

    Relations are the matrix of the possible.        <pow01 -9)>

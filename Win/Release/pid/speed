  The Need for Speed

  As you  see, HYGEN pages don't visibly load: when you make a 
  hyperlink jump, the page appears instantly. It is to demonstrate the 
  importance of speed to real hypertext reading that I make this accessible 
  in 2021 via a DOS emulator called DOSBox. The linguistics content is 
  mostly superseded I think, but accurate for its day and readable. 

  Speed is one of the characteristics that I enumerate in a _Medium_ 
  article that links to this page (at https://medium.com/p/4bb6c7c88cea).
  These characteristics are things that could have been built into the 
  web in 1989, but are still lacking because developers are more concerned
  with using new tech than making old tech like the html protocol more usable 
  for browsers (meaning people-who-browse in this case). Even that term, 
  "browsers" gives the impression that there is no rush. The fact is that 
  a lag of more than 1/20 of a second breaks the flow of reading. See or 
  return to the _Medium_ article to get the reasons why. This is merely 
  the demo of the concept.

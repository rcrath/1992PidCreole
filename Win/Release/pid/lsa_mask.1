**** Camouflage and masking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mask>

Camouflage and masking refer to a superstrate form used with a substrate meaning or function.  An example is "wa," which resembles not only English "one," but a number of African constructions as well, most notably the noun class marker "wa" in Kikongo.  It is generally glossed as an indefinite article, but often it serves other functions, having no English correlates, that are related to limiting nouns, but not in the same way as are articles.

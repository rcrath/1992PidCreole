**** Pidgins -- functional expansion of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pid-func>
If no common language is available among substrate groups who are in close quarters in situations beyond that of the pidgin's direct application (as a language of work or of trade, for example), then the functions for which it is used will tend to expand, especially if the pidgin's fprm is stabilizing. If it acquires native speakers it will expand its function to include representational functions, but will cease to be considered a pidgin to the extent that it does so.  Without this creolization, functional expansion may proceed slowly if the pidgin has formally stabilized somewhat, but the additions will still be communicative rather than representative.  The change will be one of degree rather than kind as long as acquisition is non-native.  .

 --  The loss of reciprocity:
                                             UP:<ahisyn1 -recip>

    In a synchronic system, relations become reducible to "X did Y to Z"  rather than being domains that make it possible for entities to interact temporally.  This is a result of fixing the boundaries of the system.  In the power relations model presented here,                                                <pow1 -N(s> 

    {FOR-TO possible [{Y do reciprocally [X,Z]}]}  

would become 

    _{Y do-to [X,Z]}_ 

once the effects of time are removed. 

In other words, the generalized relation,
    "It is possible for X and Z to interact in certain ways"  would become 

    "X does Y to Z."

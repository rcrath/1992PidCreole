**** Decreolization and the post-creole continuum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mat>
Creoles also appear to undergo a process of decay and eventual obsolescence in some instances where contact with the superstrate continues.  This process is called decreolization, and is usually attended by a phenomenon called a post-creole continuum, in which speakers range from a more creolized variety, the basilect, toward and intermediate varitiy (mesolect) toward the standard, or acrolect.  The "-lect" terms represent poles in a continuum--except mesolect, which represents the continuum itself rather than a particular position.  They are most accurately employed as directions (e.g. basilectal or toward the basilect) than as categories.  
Most speakers will be able to shift through a range of this gamut but not the whole length of it.  Some speakers may have two small ranges--one closer to standard, and one nearer to creole--instead of one large one.

The application of the principles and constraints of historicity to Siegel's model make possible an approach to an explanatorily adequate synthesis of generative and sociolinguistic positions.  The key to reconciling these two paradigms of pidginization and creolization is to recognize that each deals with qualitatively different aspects of the same problem, each of which behaves according to a slightly different set of diachronic constraints.  This shifts the focus away from which is "right" toward what each explains.  Generative models privilege the individual and seek to explain how such individuals represent their world, both expressively and perceptually, through language.  Sociolinguistic approaches are more concerned with what takes place between and among individuals, with communication and context privileged rather than representation.  In generative models, society is reduced to the sum of individual representations with no absolute surety that what Habermas calls "ideal communication" ever takes place.  In sociolinguistic models, communication, context and community are objectified and become the primary determinants of the individual.

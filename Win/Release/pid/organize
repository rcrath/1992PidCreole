Issues in Pidgin and creole Linguistics,  especially 
for historians 

Pidgin and creole linguistics is a relatively young and presently
contentious branch of linguistics. <p-c_hist> Disagreements
sometimes arise even at the level of basic terminology. 
Definition of terms both by states <state00> (pidgins and
creoles) and by processes <proc00> (pidginization and
creolization) helps ground any creolist theory within proper 
constraints on form and function by looking at development
through time rather than at any one point bereft of its social
and historical context. {<sochst00> or perhaps to <soclng00> 

'the relations of pidgins and creoles to each other and language
in general'
The differences and similarities between pidgin development and
creole development need to be explained in a way that also
explicates their relations to each other across a variety of
situations. {<inc> --mono- or poly- genesis--How are P's & C's
related--discrete or continuous? role of universasls and context}

The relation between pidgins and creoles and other language
varieties needs to be examined as well. {<inc> --when are they
"languages?" what are the differences in the processes of
change?}.  Perhaps some of the sets of polar opposites now used
actually belong to different sets of axes. {<pt-of-vw>--describe
current axes}

Currently, theoretical and practical approaches to pidgin and
creole studies can be divided roughly into two camps, one focused
on using evidence from pidgin and creole languages to find and
explain linguistic universals; {<univ00> --get into
generative?} the other seeking to describe and explain the role
of social factors in the development of pidgin and creole
varieties.  {<soc00> --get into sociolinguistic frame} Neither
camp has dismissed the other, but efforts at synthesis have been
thusfar meagre.  This paper suggests aligning approaches more
consciously to their referents by critically examining the
perspective and assumptions that any particular approach entails,
recognizing that this in itself is an approach with its own
persapective and irreducible set of assumptions.
<c:\max\cog\theo00>  The adoption of multiple perspectives
within a historically sound frame may provide a means of
explaining seemingly contradictory data in pidgin and creole
studies. <catego01>

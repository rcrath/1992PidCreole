**** Creoles, not pidgins the locus of the bioprogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.22>
Several scholars have focused on pidgins as the locus of language universals with little result.  The idiosyncrasies of many pidgins are difficult to track and analyze, the lects being much more provisional than creoles.   Although it is conceivable that pidgins show a tendency to be less marked, this possibility would in all liklihood be obliberated by the workings of pidgin power-relations.  When a pidgin stabilizes to the point of being analyzable as in any way homogenous, it is the result of the institutionalization, perhaps calcification, of a particular set of relations, the markings of which overrule unmarked defaults wherever conflict between the two occurs.

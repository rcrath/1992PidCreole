Synchrony and the problem of instantaneous change
                                    UP: <pow1> {<inc> <ahist00>}

    The tack most often used to skirt the issue of instantaneous change is to demarcate an "ethnographic present" or some other domain of synchronic analysis--a bounded duration of time past that can be analyzed as a present instant that happened.  Once this idealization has been made, the problem of time can be dispensed with it along with the results of the action.  
As a result, in synchronic analysis, groups can be considered as aggregates because membership can be fixed at an idealized point in time, permitting outside boundaries to be fixed as well, allowing treatment of the whole in an undifferentiated manner--i.e., as an aggregate.

    The reduction of temporal relations to a synchronic analysis has three results.
    --   The reciprocity of the relation is lost.    <ahisyn1.1>      --   Possibilities become analyzable as events.  <ahisyn1.2>      --   The selective introduction of historical context into             the synchronic analysis allows events to be construed              as trends.                                 <ahisyn1.3>

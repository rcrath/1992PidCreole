**** Pidginization -- definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <proc00>

Pidginization entails a culture-transfering process where negotiation and compromise have to take place as a prerequisite for the possibility, not ensured, of either shared cultural understanding or sense of community arising among any ethnically diverse population consisting largely of first generation immigrants.  Individuals' identities remain intact and perhaps at odds.  Only in creole, that is native born, acquirers of a language or culture would the process ensure shared understandings and sense of community--but it would not be a process of negotiation and compromise of competing cultural identities, but rather the acquisition of base identities in a shared context.

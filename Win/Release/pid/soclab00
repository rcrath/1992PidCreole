VARIATION                                           <soclab02.00>
    Labov is most well known for his research on variation in
    the usage of features within well-defined communities.  

THEORY                                              <soclab01.00>
    Labov is critical of structuralist theory's failure to
    account for the facts of language as spoken. 

SPEECH COMMUNITY                                    <soclab03.00>
    Labov uses sets of variable features as the criteria for
    defining his speech communities.

LANGUAGE AND SOCIETY                                <soclab04.00>
    Labov's construct of the relationship between language and
    society is compared to Hymes' position.

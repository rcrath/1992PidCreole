**** Consensus models of power relations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pow.2>

Positional, or consensus, models seek to assign differing amounts of power, perhaps manifested as status or material wealth to individuals or communities in some form of rank ordering.   Substrate/superstrate models assign positions to language groups.  Labovian models introduce continua and variables, but are concerned with position rather than relations between positions.  Bickerton's dynamic wave model made the linguistic features of class positions implicational.

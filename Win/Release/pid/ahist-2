Contesting the adequacy of behavioural input

Creolists have reached a theoretical impasse.  At issue is the nature, origins and development of pidgins and creoles.  Two fundamentally different theoretical frames--one generative and the other sociolinguistic--have polarized debate.  Although mutually contradictory at the surface, each system is relatively consistent within its own terms.  Generative models, epitomized by Derek Bickerton's bioprogram hypothesis, are centered on how individuals learn to represent their worlds linguistically from seemingly inadequate behavioral input.  In contrast, sociolinguistic models, whether substrate, superstrate, relexification, or some combination thereof, focus on the role that cultural contact plays in determining the features of a speech community's lect.  The community, in turn, determines the speech of the individual.  Sociolinguistic models of creolization focus on communication rather than representation.   The contested ground between the two models concerns the adequacy of behavioral input.  An historicist frame can temper the exuberance of claims by filtering synchronic possibilities through the sieve of possible "when's" and "where's."

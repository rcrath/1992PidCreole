**** Post-creole continuum: the dynamic wave model 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_post>
Derek Bickerton was to take this idea and add the implicationality to it, based on his fieldwork in Guyana.  Bickerton thought that basilectal and acrolectal features entailed other features, so that if a speaker had one feature, other features could automatically be assumed to be present.  Using a dynamic wave model of post-creole continuum, Bickerton contended that basilectal forms reflected the oldest available language features, whether drawn from substrate or superstrate sources, while acrolectal features reflected the most recent revisions to the system.  His methodology has come under sharp attack for including the same speaker in two different speech situations as two speakers.  As a result of its Labovian genealogy, it is subject to some of the same criticisms leveled at Labov concerning the nature of class relations.  Taboret-Keller and LePage have been particulary critical of this model with their paradigm of a multidimensial semiotic space.

26) Slave ethnicity--preferences vs. availability 
Some planters preferred particular ethnicities, especially Akans in Jamaica, a factor which tempers Mintz and Price's hypothesis.  Evidence from shipping lists further qualifies the mixing hypothesis, because even if planters adopted that strategy, supplies of ethnically homogenous slave cargoes often precluded meeting such demands (Thornton, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 192-205).}

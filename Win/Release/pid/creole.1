**** Creoles and Creolization defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <creole00>


In some instances the children of the speakers of a pidgin will grow up using the pidgin as a native language.  In these cases the reduced contact language must expand in its role to function as a complete language, a process called creolization.  Vocabulary is expanded, phonology and syntax are regularized, and the language is used in all situations rather than just in the limited context of trade or labor relations.  At this point it has become a creole.

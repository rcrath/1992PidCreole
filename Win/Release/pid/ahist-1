___A call for historicity________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist00 -call>


The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between historical methodology and pidgin and creole studies. The focus is on the contributions that a historical perspective can make to this field.  A nuanced sense of historicity--i.e. historical authenticity in one's approach--is integral to grounding any creolization hypothesis within temporal constraints.  The benefits of such an approach include a greater opportunity to synthesize antithetical positions.  A number of important differences among creolists owe their seeming irreconcilability to the application of synchronic methods of analysis to diachronic problems.

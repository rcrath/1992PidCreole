**** Pidgins -- stabilization of 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <piddev00>
Stabilization means that highly idiolectal pidgins -- what Siegel calls "jargons" -- become more homogenous at the level of community.  It has nothing to do with whether or not the variety is expanding in function or form, although if it remains a pidgin, it must stabilize before it can expand.  A pidgin will stabilize when it is used in a place where a continuous supply of dislocated speakers of uncommon languages has become the norm.  Otherwise, it may die out possibly to be replaced or superceded by a creole language.

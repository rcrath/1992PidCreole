**** Monogenetic relexification -- Whinnom's hypothesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mono.1>

Whinnom's relexification hypothesis was that the widespread common features of creole languages were the result of its single source--the Mediterranean trading language or _Lingua Franca_.  This language, or more to the point, _Sabir_, the trading language used in the Crusades,  was continually outfitted with new, mixed lexicons in order to meet the exigincies of trade with non-European-speaking populations.  According to this model, it was subsequently relexified by the Portuguese, and then later by Africans, English, French and others. {Ian Hancock, "West Africa and the Atlantic Creoles," essay in The English Language in West Africa, John Spenser, ed., London: Longman Group, 1971, 113-117;  Wardaugh, 74.}

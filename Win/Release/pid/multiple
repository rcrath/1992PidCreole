A strategy to overcome the difficulties inherent to synthetic or discrete adoption of universalist or substratist frames is to adopt multiple perspectives from within a historicist frame, modelling the problem rather than adopting a model.  In order to do this, flexible categories capable of overlap with other categories need to be employed, but these categories still have to be sufficiently exclusive enough to avoid explaining everything and so doing explaining nothing.   Temporal constraints provide sufficient limits to explain boundary problems inherent to synchronic-only approaches.  They differentiate between hindsight and foresight, the finished and the possible.  They provide explicit means of locating agency and what it treats, namely object.

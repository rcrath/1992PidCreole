**** Hymes' contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <soclng00>

    Hymes has made three major programatic contributions to sociolinguistics.  He defined the scope of the field.  He labelled a particular subfield "the ethnography of speaking," and plotted its boundaries as well.  He set this sector as a direct challenge to ideas of linguistic competence that did not include social aspects of the language with his theory of "communicative competence."  Ideologically, he perceives his methodology as "liberating" to its objects of study.

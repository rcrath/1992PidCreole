***** Universalist and Africanist theories, a synthesis 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.2>
John Sutcliffe best sums up recent calls for a synthesis of the two positions: 
    "Universals theory is still, perhaps, seen as in opposition
     to the 'Africanist' theory, and obviously a true
     understanding of what Atlantic Creoles are and how they
     were formed will eventually bring the two apparently 
     opposing theories together." {<inc> Sutcliffe 12 }

His synthesis, however raises new aspects of an old problem--how and whether to disaggregate the "pan-African" from the "global."   In fact, there is a striking resemblence between Willaim Welmers's assertion of a pan-Niger Kordofonian clause structure and Noam Chomsky's "minimalist" approach.  In particular, compare Welmers' "CONSTRUCTION MARKER + PRONOUN + MODAL + VERB + TONAL AFFIX" with Chomsky's argument for lexical head-projected chains operating within the parameters of a universal X-bar grammar.  {<inc> Welmers quoted in Sutcliffe 57. Chomsky 1992, passim, but esp. 24, 26, 28-30)}  This is an old problem for students of African culture in the Americas, creolists included, one which structuralism and geneaology fail resoundingly to address.  Generative and historicist approaches remain. ............................................... <ahist00>

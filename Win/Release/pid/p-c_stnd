**** Standardization and diglossia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mat>

Mature creoles may become the standard, as in the case of Saramaccan, or arguably, of Afrikaans.  This is generally the case when the original superstrate population ceases to dominate, or as in Afrkaans, when one adstrate creolizes toward the others.  The power relations during the formulation of Afrikaans were too complex and the political ramifications of their labels are still too immediate to be categorized historically as simply substrates and superstrates without blurring.  
Alternatively, a diglossic siutuation may develop, as in Haiti, where Creole is spoken in everyday usage while standard French is used for many government and formal purposes.  This too, is changing, however, as Haitian Creole is making inroads into what used to be the exclusive domain of French.

*The bioprogram, representation, and communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.22>
In the domain of synchronic aggregates, pidginization and creolization shade imperceptibly into each other and on the whole are distinguishable from more general process of language change in anything but degree, if that.  In the domain of an individual agent with a particular history, however, the process of acquiring one's language from within a heterogenous speech community (creolization) is discrete from negotiating its usage and meaning in a heterogenous speech community (pidginization).  The first is the acquisition of a means of representing oneself, the second a way of communicating representations in a particulr societal context.  

 -- make sure to specifically hook this into def of group--it includes researchers and bad learners rather than the aggregate, which constitutes the "speech community" {<inc> }

25) Limits of superstrate power
Planters had (and by definition used) the power to create groups of dislocated peoples.  Although they controlled the structures of these groups, slaveholders were unable and unwilling to control the contents of the local communities which such groups built within the structures.  Planters distanced themselves from the everyday community of the enslaved, leaving each group in relative cultural isolation.  While the planter goal of mixing diverse ethnicities was not met to the degree it was prescribed, enslaved Africans found themselves in groups which had no culture or language native to all.  Pidginization, of both languages and cultures, was the process by which they negotiated viable communities in the first generations.

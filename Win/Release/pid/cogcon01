I want to develop a working model of culture from a cognitive perspective which I can use to approach historical problems of erasure do to selective and biased documentation.  My working definition for culture is "the way people actively make sense of their world by constructing and imposing patterns upon it.  Cultural patterns are not discerned from nature, but rather generated by humans in an uncionscious way.  I need to know what culture does in evolutionary and biological terms--what if anything is hardwired, in what order, and how?
I want to use the model to uncover the histories of people who have left scant traces in the documentary evidence because of illiteracy and oppression.  What is recorded is often biased, as in the descriptions of Anne Hutchinson in New England, or accounts of slave life.  
In the domain of African-American culture in Early America, this problem has been approached in two way--first, by taking the surface evidence available of quantifiable things from contemporary sources recorded by slaveholders and corroborating them with qualitative travel accounts and runaway descriptions.  There is limited evidence, which decreases as one delves further into the past.  Also, the conclusions which can be drawn are limited largely to description.  The other approach has been to draw upon slave narratives and accounts of people who were in slavery as youths.  These provide extensive descriptions--alltold, there are probably 40 volumes of slave or ex-slave narratives in existence.  The problem with these is that they lend undue weight to the final period of slavery, when the institution was on its lasdt legs.  The slave narratives were generally edited to a standard format to meet the abolitionist cause which funded their publication.  Ex-slave narratives were usually remeniscences of a few years from childhood spent in slavery--often during the Civil war.  The largest corpus, the WPA NArratives, was not collected until 1938.  The result is an ahistoirical approach to slave culture which is misleading.
What I would do with a cognitive model of culture is look for forms and processes which Europeans recorded without being aware of what they were describing.  Often things which frightened them or amused them as odd have biased surface descriptions, but contain descriptions of what puzzled them as well.  Much of what comprises culture takes place unconsciously at the level of how it gets externally represented.  In order to be mutually understood (or incomprehensible to outsiders), external representationb needs to be done in agreed upon, mutually comprehensible ways.  I think that these are often recorded in older documents, and when they can be aligned with quantitative/descriptive work as well as the discoveries of later slave life and anthropological work on African culturews, elements of a history, changing through time, can be formed, with slaves as active agents rather than simply patients who were operated on.

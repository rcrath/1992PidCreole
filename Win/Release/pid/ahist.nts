6) Creolist impasse resembles Herskovits Frazier impasse

In some respects, this deadlock resmbles one encountered by historians of the African diaspora concerning whether Africans transported to the Americas were able to retain their cultures under conditions of slavery or whether those cultures were destroyed by enslavement. 


7) suggest historicism as approach to synthesis

Historicism offers a way to sort the generative from the contextual and points to a synthesis much called for by recent carib. creole studies (Holm, Lalla, Figueroa Sutcliffe, ...)

9) Limits of historicism; multiple perspectives as antidote. 

An approach that privileges the historical depends on the conceit that events and processes can be unambiguously reconstructed from artifacts before they are interpreted.  Historiography privileges description, assuming (correctly or not) that what "really happened" can be known, even if its causes are not.  Internal consistency and rational intent can be pondered later or even dismissed rather than presupposed. Just like society and individual interact to form and be formed by each other, so do historical description and interpretation.  It is another, rather than a better, perspective, and as such it may throw into relief features and relations obscured by synchronic perspectives

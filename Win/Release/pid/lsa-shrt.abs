The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between historical methodology and pidgin and creole studies, focusing on the contributions that a historical perspective can make.  A nuanced sense of historicity--i.e. historical authenticity in one's approach--is integral to grounding any creolization hypothesis.  Differences between generativist and sociolinguistic frames in pidgin and creole theory often owe their seeming irreconcilability to the application of synchronic methods of analysis to diachronic problems.  Ahistoricism can provide the base for a theory that is internally consistent but nonetheless counterfactual.  Prematurely ruling out a competing theory on non-linguistic grounds, the need to engage with contradictory positions is dismissed and the possibility of an adequate synthesis is hastily foreclosed.  The key to reconciliation and possible synthesis is to recognize that generative and sociolinguistic paradigms deal with qualitatively different aspects of the same problem, each of which behaves according to a slightly different set of diachronic constraints.  This shifts the focus away from which position is "right" toward what each explains.  Rather than curtailing theoretical debate, an historical perspective can provide a domain in which different theoretical frames can engage more meaningfully.

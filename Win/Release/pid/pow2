**** Power relations in pidgin and creole language systems.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <power00>

Scholars treat power relations in pidgin and creole language systems in either of two ways: positionally or relationally.  The matter cannot be ignored in any responsible study because of the effects of colonialism.  Both approaches have advantages and shortcomings.  Positional models are empirically testable but miss conflicts with their assumptions of consensus.  Relational models may attribute conflict to class position or see conflict as the measure of class membership.  In other words, they rely on assumptions of a closed community.  Most approaches favor one or the other but incorporporate both positional and relational information to some extent.  Issues of power relations as manifested in race, gender, and ethnic relations are integral to this work, but oftenm left unaddressed.

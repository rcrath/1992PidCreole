1) wide importance of pidgin and creole studies

creole studies has too much of importance to offer to be lost reductionist encampment.
Theories of creolization have provided a synthesis that has been utilized in breaking a seemingly irreconcilable impasse in a long-standing debate among historians  
2) Generative vs sociolinguistic approaches in historical studies

--More recent generative approaches have been shied away from or misunderstood and dismissed outright, often on political rather than evidential grounds. 
--Few scholars studying cultural origins have tried the application of generative models, most rejecting them as deterministic.
--sociolinguistic approaches to creolization are popular among historians--applying creolist theories of language to constructs of culture--Brathwaite most eloquent, Joyner, Gwendolyn Midlo Hall.    
4) Disciplinary borderlands

long tradition of unacknowledged theoretical borrowing in the interdisciplinary borderlands--Glassie, Kurath, Turner Thesis and westweard migration patterns--Fischer's use of Kurath's map of Glassie's exztension of Kurath's data on the basis of historical evidence....(relevance??) 
35) Ceolization of interest to historians

The implications of this process justifiably fascinate historians.  Language not only carries culture, it is a primary constituent of it.  Insights into the processes of pidginization and creolization therefore necessarily illuminate aspects of cultural continuity and change within any community whose language has undergone this process.  Unfortunately, as a whole, interdisciplinary users of the concept of creolization have borrowed dated or incomplete models, and run into dead ends as a result.

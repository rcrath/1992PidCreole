**** Pidgin--substratist definition 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <state00>

John Holm defines a pidgin as "a reduced language that results from extended contact between groups of people with no language in common; it evolves when they need some means of verbal communication, perhaps for trade, but no group learns the native language of any other group for social reasons that may include lack of trust or of close contact. Usually those with less power (speakers of the *substrate* languages) are more accommodating and use words from the language of those with more power (the *superstrate*), although the meaning, form and usage of these words may be influenced by the substrate languages." ({<inc> Holm88} 4-5)

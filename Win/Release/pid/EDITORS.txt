EDITORS and this hypertext utility

  --	A very useful function of this hygen hypertext program is the ability 
	to invoke an editor from any screen.  This feature might not 
	work from floppies, but runs from a hard disc.
  -- 	The editor included here is E.  For instructions on how to use it, 
	see <e.doc>. The help screen (alt-H) ought to be sufficient to use 
	it for most purposes.  It automatically makes .BAK files, so if 
	you get to many, just delete them.
  --	A third choice is to supply your own editor.  The dos EDIT.COM
	works fine but is slow to load on many machines, a real fault in
	hypertext applications.  Your regular word processor could also
	be invoked if your machine has enough memory.  You can use 
	WordPerfect's shell editor, ED.EXE.  This is my preference, because 
	then the default editor can be set to WP and if your file is ascii, 
	ED will very quickly come up, and if your file is WordPerfect, WP 
	will come up automatically, if a bit slower.
  --	The editor is set by changing a part of a line in the text 
	file <config.hn>.  This can be done now, if the editor function 
	is working, by making the hypertext jump to <config.hn> and 
	pressing "E" to edit it.

**** Monogenetic relexification, problems of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mono.1>
    Monogenetic relexification has been largely discounted in its strong form. It has not withstood historical scrutiny.  The needed connections and human contacts have not been forthcoming.  The superstrate versions have the additional onus of explaining new evidence which places the earliest documented creoles as the developments of entirely African societies. There are logical problems as well.  For one, the features left in common in existing creoles are both too scarce and too general to confidently attribute fully to any one specific language.  In addition, it is dubious that a speaker would learn the grammar, but not the vocabulary of language.  A final related argument is that the same syntactical features are found in pidgins and creoles all around the world, but the vocabularies are widely varied, many with nothing in common at all. {<inc> Bickerton, Dynamics, 57-59; Wardaugh, 73-74.}

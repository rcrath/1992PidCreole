                                                 UP:<pow1>

In the course of defining relations of power, several insights
into relations in general have been uncovered:


 --  Factoring out power from the definitions yields an      
     interesting general definition of relations.       <pow1.1>

 --  The domain of the relations is ineffable.          <pow1.2>

 --  A perfect definition of relations is unobtainable  <pow1.3>

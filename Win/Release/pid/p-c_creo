**** Creolization -- prototypical definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_prot>

Creolization is the process of forming a native language from mutually unintelligible sources.  It is the acquisition of a complete and adequate native set (ie, language, culture...) from input that immigrant members considered inadequate.  Its locus is in an individual speaker embedded in a community.  Native acquisition is not to be confused with monolingual assumptions of first acquisition being the same as native acquisition.  At issue is not the order, because in multilingual situations, more than one language may be acquired by a speaker as native; nor is the overall linguistic situation in the community at stake, even though both these factors may influence the formal properties of the acquired language.  What is and is not a creole will be emically clear, even if etically blurred.

**** Status and Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <power00>

Status placement is a method of classifying power.  The standard method of dealing with power relations as generalizations is to divide the donor languages, and by implication, the pidgin or creole speech community into strata.  One problem with discrete strata is that it assumes upward ascription to be valued over class or community solidarity.  This has been challenged by Rickford, among others.  
Instead of focusing on donor languages, other researchers have concentrated on the relations among stylistic ranges on a status gradient based entirely on linguistic factors before correlation with social factors--the post creole continuum.  This model has also been challenged for being two-dimensional, especially in the work of Taboret-Keller and LePage.

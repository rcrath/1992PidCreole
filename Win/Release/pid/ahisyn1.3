--   Events become construed as trends 
                                            UP: <ahisyn1 -trend>      Once the reciprocity of the relationship has been lost and possibilities have been reduced to past events, then historical artifacts can be introduced into a synchronic argument as
'context' and 'evidence,' ignoring the fact that once the
dynamics of a relation have been dispensed with (_viz._ time), such artifacts can only be used as stereotypes.  This is how synchronic analysis is capable of generalizing artificially construed events into systemically global trends.

In this way, a non-reciprocal, past-event synchronic analysis of a relationship such as:                         {<inc> see above}      "The result of the relationship was that one entity
    could AND DID interact with another in a particular
    way."
becomes
    The relationship is such that one entity continually acts      upon the other in a particular way.

As such, a synchronic description of power relations would then become "Who gets to do what to whom" with all the slots filled unambiguously--an effective blaming strategy (itself often the result of reciprocal power relations) but a poor analytic tool.

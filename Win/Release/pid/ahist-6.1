___Anachronism and irony_________________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist-6 -perspective>

Linguistic and historical arguments are inextricably enmeshed in pidgin and creole studies.  Ahistoricism often cannot be corrected once it is introduced.  What is required, in the words of James H. Merrell, is for one to "abandon hindsight and adopt the actors' point of view." (1989, xi)  This involves the inversion of some terms and techniques.  For example, anachronism, which usually refers to a quaint survival no longer appropriate to the present, refers in the historical sense to a projection of today's perceptions onto a past where they may have had little or no relevance.  Another familiar concept, irony, is usually regarded as an intentionally deployed device used to reveal incongruities between ideal and actual, between design and outcome.  In contrast, historical irony is observed rather than deployed by the author: it concerns the unintended repercussions of purposive acts, the former often overshadowing the latter in importance.   Predicting the past can be replaced by an explanation of it in terms useful to the present.

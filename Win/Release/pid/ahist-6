___Historicism as a synthetic tool_______________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist00 -synthetic>

Historical methodology can be used to more accurately frame synchronic models of pidgin and creole languages in time as well as place.

Perspective                                           <ahist-6.1>
 -- Predicting the past: anachronism and irony

Possibilities                                         <ahist-6.2>
 -- Recognizing the different diachronic miens of generative and      sociolinguistic approaches

Limits                                                <ahist-6.3>
 -- Historicity as a constraint upon possible theories and      perspectives

A narrative frame can provide insights as well as limits by allowing a closer approach to the point of view of a person or people facing time without benefit of hindsight.

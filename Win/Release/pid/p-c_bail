Beryl Loftman Bailey made at least two important contributions to the field of creole linguistics. 

Her 1966 _Jamaican Creole Syntax: A Transformational Approach_ was an emic description of the _Aspects_ era deep structures of Jamaican Creole English. Bailey, a native Jamaican, relied upon her own linguistic intuitions to derive the deep structures Jamaican Creole English.  She also postulated an early creolization hypothesis for North American Black English, saying that some differences between it and standard American English are attributable to features in its deep structures which had creole origins.

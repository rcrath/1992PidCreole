'recent issues'

    What it is that is relexified {<inc> def.} has proven the
most volatile issue in recent creole studies.  Points of
contention include: 
(1) the extent that the relexified variety retains or adopts
phonemic and morphemic referents vis a vis allophonic and
allomorphic {<inc> --define -emic, -etic, allo-, --see Pike, tie
in importance} incursions of the lexifier or lexifiers; and

(2) whether relexification maps onto 
    (A) a universal grammar (Bickerton's hypothesis {<inc>
Bick-81}) or 
    (B) onto a particular language's grammar <dumb --socioling.
theories> or 
    (C) a combination of grammars.  

(3) This has resulted in a dichotomy situated along two strange,
perhaps non-euclidean, sets of axes:  Theoretical/sociological
and  universal/substrate <pt-of-vw -substrate>.  The genesis of
these splits can be traced in the history outlined above
<univ_vs.sub> 
(4) as situated in the larger context of the academic world and
the world at large during the last century. <soc_vs_b.ick>

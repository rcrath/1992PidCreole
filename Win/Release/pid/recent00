**** Current trends

The lack of explanatory value of polygenetic approaches has prevented their renaissance, but they insist on implicitly entering most current theories without permission from their authors.  If creoles are to be treated as distinct types of language (which is itself a matter of some contention), their distinction arising from their mixed genealogy, then some weak form of relational polygenesis seems unavoidable.  Sociolinguistics has continually provided evidence of the need for polygenetic models of mixing at some point in the process. <soc00> Relexification without monogenesis has evolved in the past few decades from a model of mixed vocabulary mapped onto a single, fixed grammar to how the lexicon and grammar interact with semantics, morphology and phonology in their situated socio-historical contexts.  
Recently, polygenetic, relexification, and sociolinguistic approaches have all been syncretized to great effect, largely in opposition to Bickerton's bioprogram hypothesis, a monogenetic explanation that relies on universals of human language.

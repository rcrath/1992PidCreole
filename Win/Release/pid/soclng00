**** Sociolinguistics -- early trends 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <soc00> <p-c_hist>

    The 1960s marked the coming of age of sociolinguistics, both in what Dell Hymes has labeled the "ethnography of speaking" and in its more quantitative forms, epitomized in the work of William Labov on variation. A number of scholars have used one or both approaches to great advantage. This in turn has made a huge contribution toward establishing the concrete and the particular of pidgin and creole language genesis and use, particularly in mapping the extent and limits of substrate/superstrate interaction and influence.

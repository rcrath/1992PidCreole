Perhaps the most important assumption underlying Baker's and Corne's model is the notion of a community.  In island populations, clear regional boundaries exist.  If the economy was geared mostly toward plantation enterprise, then the aggregate could be treated homogenously.  This model could be misused in other situations, however.  For example, in the discussion on creole origins of the African American English of North America, This work could be used to argue against creole origins in any areas outside of South Carolina, the only black majority region during the period of early settlement.  This could be further supported by evidence that Gullah and its genealogical relatives are presently the only viable North American African-English creoles.  However, it would fail to explain documentary evidence of creolized varieties in non-majority regions during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

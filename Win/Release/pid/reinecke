**** Reinecke's contributions, 1935-75'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_hist>



     John Reinecke, who started his linguistic career in 1935,
was responsible for putting the discipline on an independent
scholarly footing.  He proposed classifying pidgins and creoles
on the basis of their context, form and function.  He
distinguished among plantation creoles, in which the speakers had
lost contact with the substrate language, settler's creoles, in
which the speakers remained in contact with the substrate, and
trade jargons or pidgins. ({<inc> holm88} 40-42)

  The Slow Hypertext Movement

  It was the era when 300 Baud modems gave way to 54K speeds that
  made text based browsing somewhat bearable.  No longer did you
  need to read as slowly as the lines came up on screen, but unless
  you were on a university T-1 line (even most students had to use
  the ISPs of the day, which were all dial-up), loading an image file
  was a five or ten minute wait. for a pixelized aliased compressed
  jpg if you needed a higher resolution image and had the appropriate
  GUI (Mac or Windows), you were in for an overnight wait for your
  image file to download. But most of us were on <MS_DOS>

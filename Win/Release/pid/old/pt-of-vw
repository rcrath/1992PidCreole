**** Approaches to pidgin and creole language systems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <level01 1 4>

  -- Points of view: The emic/etic dialectic .......<emicetic.01>

  -- Most creolists try in some way to adopt the 
     point of view of their objects of study. .......<pt-of-vw.1>

  -- The theoretical approach adopted by an author plays
     an important and usually unacknowledged role in 
     determining the findings of a study. ........ <pt-of-vw.imp>

  -- Two such approaches or perspectives dominate pidgin and 
     creole studies today, each with its own assumptions,
     methods, intentions and reductions. ......... <pt-of-vw.sum>

  -- Pidgins and creoles have provided a rich source of evidence
     with which to frame and test these approaches. The adoption
     of multiple perspectives in such a context is not only
     possible, but necessary if an adequate explanation of the
     phenomena is to be had. ......................... <multiple>

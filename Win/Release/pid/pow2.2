**** Conflict models of power relations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pow2>


Relational models study the interactions among groups or individuals.  Perhaps the most eloquent on this subject has been Hymes, who has continually observed that linguistic equality is no more than an ideal in the face of actual linguistic inequality.  Taboret-Keller and Lepage are interested in the relation of individuals to the communities those individuals identify with.  Rickford used a relational approach to class to critique positional approaches of the Labovian type, examining the tensions between two groups that Labov would have seen as occupying the same position.

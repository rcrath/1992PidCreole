`    While both his correlations and causal explanations are 
often convincing, he, like anyone else building a model, has to 
make assumptions or idealizations.  ` 
    The causal order in Labov's work is left implicit.  He 
assumes that class status precedes language performance.  That 
is, status is the independent variable upon which depends 
language variation.  Marxist scholars have criticized Labov's 
privileging of social positions along a continuum in a society at

a given time over relations among, particularly tensions among, 
those positions.{<inc> Gregory Guy's article in Cambridge Survey} 

In Labov's model, linguistic gravity pulls upward along a class 
continuum.  Especially in pidgin and creole situations, the norms

are assigned their definitions and values by those occupying the

positions of power, introducing an element of circularity to 
Labov's causal order.

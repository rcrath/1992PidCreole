**** Quantitative and qualitative combined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <soclng00>

Perhaps the most fruitful domain of sociolinguistics for pidgin and creole scholars has been the middle ground which integrates insights from ethnomethodological field methods with Labov's constructs of variables and continua.  These cross-pollenized approaches have made fieldwork indispensable and interpretations of it more meaningful.  John Gumperz's work with Robert Wilson in Kupwar Village has raised a number of enduring questions and provided a paragon of careful research method for later fieldworkers to emulate, expand, and revise.   Sociolinguistics has not been able to incorporate all aspects of quantitative and qualitative approaches, however.  Two complementary studies of mixed success point this out, those of Taboret-Keller and Lepage, and Hudson.

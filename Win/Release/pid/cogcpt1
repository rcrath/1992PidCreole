* groups are derived -- I&E bounded

E-axis is environmental diffusion/bounding.--the horizontal axis is crossed
I-axis is identity diffusion/bounding.--the vertical axis is crossed
Transforming both E- and I-axes at once yields:
GROUPS-->exploited==>SUBSTANCE--bounds removed--liberation?
SUBSTANCE-->mass produced==>GROUP
re-cognition?:
INDIVIDUAL-->incorporated==>AGGREGATE I-boundary becomes E-boundary
AGGREGATE-->granted agency==>INDIVIDUAL E-boundary becomes I-boundary
  --the legal granting of individuality to a corporation is called incorporation too.

***INTEGRAL AND DERIVED
* Substance is integral -- I&E diffuse
* groups are derived -- I&E bounded
therefore, diffusion of boundaries is integration
and bounding is derivation

-- Substance is global, but empirically unanalyzable--no bounds--can't be tested or counted or compared--ineffable
-- groups are empirically analyzable, but local--can't tell anything beyond their domains
-- A substance cannot be derived, but often is assumed by integration of boundaries--i.e. by universalizing the individual, group or aggregate.  
--A substance can be assumed/constructed by diffusing/integrating, if bound, both I & E.

***DERIVATION
An individual can be derived by (bounding I) AND (diffusing E if it is bound).
A group can be derived by bounding I & E
An aggregate can be derived by (bounding E) and (diffusing/integrating I if it is bound)

--individual derived by defining of substance
--group derived by combining individuals into a domain
--A group can be derived from an aggregate by discerning/deriving members from its contents at any moment in time, giving the entity I-boundaries in addition to its E-boundaries.  

***INTEGRATION--what is integral?

I & E in diffuse state integral to substance
I bound integral to individual
*I & E bound integral to group
I diffuse and E bound integral to aggregate

derived substance is integral to individual, group, aggregate
--abstraction is integral to making substance from agregate?
--individuals are integral to groups--they are its substance.

--aggregate is integrated by objectifying substance
--group is integrated by discriminating aggregate
--individual is integrated by dividing group
--substance is integrated by abstracting individual

***DIRECTION

clockwise--discerning (content, perceiveing, empirical)
c-clockwise (form, producing, ratrionalist)

***--HOMGENEITY/HETEROGENEITY
state of substance input and its entailed forms:
homogenous
heterogenous

--If substance is homogenous then individuals can be formed from it and groups from the individuals and aggregates from the groups.--but are these categories all just constructions of the unanalyzable, substance?

--If substance is heterogeneous then aggregates can be discerned from substance and groups from aggregates and individuals from groups--but if it is heterogenous, those individuals are nothing more than aggregates themselves

--most conclusions and criticisms can be made by changing direction (discernment/generation) or assumed state of a particular category (homo/hetro-geneous).

***APPLICATIONS
* the ship problem
--How about applyiong this to the replacew the planks problem? 
    wood--plank--group of planks--a ship
* theta-roles
What is the differeence between individual and aggregate? 
--individual seems capable of intent while aggregate does not.
--aggregate is divisible--boundaries--are they "integral?" or 
 not.
******DIAGRAMS
S=substance
N=individual
G=group
A=aggregate

Chomsky--generating forms from universal(homogenous ) substance, language
forming--rationalist--counterclockwise

Taboret Keller and LePage: real empiricism: Looking for "natural" clusters of sameness in the heterogeneity from which toi form entities.  Groups of entities could then found by discerning more natural clusters and organizing them into groups.  If enough could be said about the groups, perhaps broad clusters of groups would emerge as aggregates

Saussure: discernable Homogenous substance, language, goes through aggregate, society, where it determines groups and individual language (as separate from parole, which saussure sees as the construction of the individual will--ie generation...)

Hudson and Hymes critique Chomsky for discerning (he is not discerning, but producing or formalizing) an ideal speaker unaffected by society (aggregate) or interaction (group)
 -- "a"-ing and "the"-ing are not the only ways of 
    parametrizing/categorizing in English, but it is what they
    do.  Other strategies: Topic-comment, colons, paragraphs,
    relativization.

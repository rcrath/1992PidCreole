SUPERSTRATE/SUBSTRATE                                <socgum1.31>
--Power relations in Kupwar Village are vastly different than in Atlantic Creoles, yet the synchronic results appear similar

GROUNDED THEORY                                      <socgum1.32>
--Gumperz contends that linguistic theory alone is not enough to provide adequate cultural descriptions.  Societal factors such as ethnicity and the public/private dichotomy must play an integral, rather than supplementary, role in any theoretical explanation.

MODELS OF CONVERGENCE AND CHANGE                     <socgum1.33>
--There are more types of language convergence than creolization.  Some of the phenomena that Gumperz is most concerned with would now be analyzed as koineization.

A FRAME FOR FIELDWORK                                <socgum1.34>
-- Although in some ways limiting, Gumperz' applications of interactional sociolinguistic theory have provided the most useful applied frame for exacting fieldwork to a generation of creolists.

The domain of relations is ineffable. 
                                                        <pow11>

None of the definitions (unless synchronic) of relations in
general, or of power relations in particular, provide any
means of knowing how the contents a domain are allocated to
any specific entity or action.  The domain is ineffable as
long as it remains irrealis.  As such, it cannot be
disaggregated into portions unique to any member without
constructing arbitrary divisions.  <pow01 -7>

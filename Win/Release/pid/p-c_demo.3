**** Demographic factors--event three
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_demo>

The onset of event three would mark the stabilization time of the language and what happens subsequently is influenced by the status of the variety at the end of importation.  If the break between the superstrate and substrate was mild, then the creole will perhaps reconnect along a post-creole continuum.  A greater split would result in a diglossic situation, while communities not in further contavct with the superstrate would develop autonomously.

~PIDGIN00~
A pidgin is:
A language used in contact situations where no common language is available.  It can be negotiated and provisional, or it may be more traditional and set.<pidgin01>  The form (or lack thereof) that a pidgin assumes at a particular moment is heavily dependent on its particular sociohistorical context. <sochst00>  Often a pidgin will serve only a narrow range of functions in the speakers' register <register> although over time this may expand. Expansion may proceed slowly if the pidgin survives in a stable form in an area--that is if it is used in a place where a continuos supply of dislocated speakers of uncommon languages has become the norm.  Otherwise, it may die out <dead00>, possibly to be replaced or superceded by a creole language <creole00> if natural increase in the substrate population surpasses immigration as a source for new speakers.  Obviously, generational, functional, sexual, geographical and historical factors may not be considered in isolation any more than can power relations.  Often an argument or counterargument to a particular hypothesis can be explained adequately from context without ever resorting to the theoretical position attacked or defended.  For these reasons, I prefer a broad and inclusive definition to a more restrictive one.  TRhe first sentence of the papragraph captures the necessary ingredients and I think it explains all and only cases of pidgin languages, even though further traits are often associated with the lects to support or oppose a particular theoretical perspective.

'Van Name's 1869-70 publications'
    Although several people had collected speech samples and
compiled dictionaties of various creoles previously, the first
scholarly comparative treatment of the field was Adison Van
Name's 1869-70 "Contributions to Creole Grammar," a concise
comparison of Caribbean Creoles from French, Dutch, English and
Spanish lexical bases. He raised issues of the relation between
pidgins and creoles and other kinds of language change as well as
recognizing the importance of social factors such as age and
proportion of the population.  While Van Name recognized an
African influence on creoles, he thought them essentially
European in their form and content.  His was the first opinion in
a battle over substrate influence that is still under way.

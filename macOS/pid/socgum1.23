**** Creolization with no prior pidgin 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <socgum1.2 1 13>

Gumperz and Wilson use the lack of a previous pidgin in the Kupwar village public language situation to question the distinction of creole languages from other languages on any grounds other than their histories (which the authors dismiss).  This is in line with the "normalizing" agenda of sociolinguistics which seeks to treat all forms of language shift by the same set of criteria rather than having one set for insider languages and one set for "other" cultures.  This especially fits with Hymes's goal of linguistic "liberation."  It is questionable whether they succeed, because several current definitions of a creole continue to posit them as discrete phenomena from other forms of languagfe change, but remove the prerequisite for a prior pidgin.

--as language usage that reflects societal norms

Gumperz defines sociolinguistics as "the study of language usage
as it reflects more general behavior norms."  Like other
sociolinguists, he is concerned with language as it is used for
communication, writeing that "although not all communication is
language, language is by far the most powerful and versatile
medium of communication." In addition, as a sociolinguist
employing the ideas of ethnomethodology <interact.01> he
approaches linguistic behavior as a phenomenon embedded within,
but inseparable from, the normative action of the "socially
defined universe." {<inc> Gumperz 1972b Speech Comm 219}

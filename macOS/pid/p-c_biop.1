The Bioprogram hypothesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <recent00>
Stated concisely, the bioprogram hypothesis is as follows:
As a result of the social upheaval entailed in the historical context of colonial power relations, children were often born into communities in which there was no adequate model of language for them to acquire.  Relying on the innate capacity of humans for constructing languages, these children acquired--as they made--fully expanded and functional creole languages which were less marked, and therefore closer to the biological endowment for language than other languages.

The justification for this thesis arises from three sources:
 -- The failure of polygenesis in explaining the genesis of
    pidgin and creole languages                     <p-c_poly.2>
 -- The historical improbabilities of a strong form of
    relexification                                  <p-c_mono.3>
 -- The need to explain similarities among far-flung creole
    lects                                           <p-c_mono.2>

Bickerton's thesis has been vociferously contended moreso than engaged with ....................................... <p-c_biop.2>

**** Point of view assigned by researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pt-of-vw>
Most creolists try to adopt as best as possible the point of view of their objects of study.                   

 -- Recent studies have been made from the perspective of native
    speakers of the language under scrutiny. ..... <pt-of-vw.11>

 -- Much work has, either implicitly or explicitly, a 
    genealogical bent to it, including superstrate 
    and substrate analyses. ...................... <pt-of-vw.12>

 -- Most work at some point attempts to adopt the perspective of
    a person or community in the situation of needing such a
    language at a particular moment in time.  While valuable at
    the level of local synchronic knowledge, these perspectives 
    often cause confusion when they are monolithically applied
    to global processes and states. .............. <pt-of-vw.13>

 -- A synthetic use of multiple, situated approaches to 
    language, individual, community and history can be used to
    make sense of seemingly contradictory indications.

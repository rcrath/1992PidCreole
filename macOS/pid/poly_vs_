**** Poly- vs mono-genesis: Hall and Taylor'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <P-C_hist 1 17>
With the maturation of creole studies in the 1950s came two schools of thought--the monogenetic approach, which believed in a common origin for all pidgins and creoles, and a polygenetic approach, which explained similarities between pidgins as arising from different substratum languages which were all aiming at acquiring a common target, or superstratum, language such as English. Keith Whinnom and Douglas Taylor were the leading proponents of the former position, while Robert Hall was an important advocate of the latter.  {<inc> Wardaugh, 72. }

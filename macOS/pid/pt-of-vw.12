**** Genealogical bent of suubstrate/superstrate approaches 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pt-of-vw.1>
What I mean by a genealogical bent is that origins, whether superstrate or substrate, are considered in isolation and then generalized onto a mixed community.  This can result in contradictory findings from the same sets of data, each presented as historical fact.  The power of genealogies needs to be recognized, but so do the limits of interpretation.   Mixed genealogies co-exist; it is only in hindsight that the patterns can be set.  The theoretical tools to deal with mixed histories without relying on monolithic genealogies are available and in use in some studies, particualrly in Sutcliffe and Figueroa's _System in Black English_ .  They include the concepts of convergence, recutting, and other ways of multiply interpreting the same piece of evidence.

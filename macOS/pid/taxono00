**** Pidgin and creole language systems -- classifying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <level01 -Class>
Particularized definitions of pidgin and creole language systems virtually all fail to meet some necessary or sufficient condition imposed on them by their respective authors and critics.  Often stages that a language passes through are conflated with the process that carries them to, and perhaps past, that particular stage.  Jeff Siegel's developmental taxonomy carefully distinguishes, while not disaggregating, state from process.  As his series of models demonstrates, neither state nor process can be considered alone if a classification of pidgin and creole language systems is to carry effective explanatory power.  As good as it is, Siegel's model is still subject too, albeit fewer, exceptions.  A more flexible definitional criterion than "necessary and sufficient" would be a boon to any attempt at synthesis--if it were still capable of adequately discerning types of varieties.

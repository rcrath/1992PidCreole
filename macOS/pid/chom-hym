**** Perspectives compared: Chomsky, Hymes and Saussure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <intuit00>
Saussure justified language as an autonomous subject of inquiry in the following way: "Language is comparable to a symphony in that what the symmphony actually is stands completely apart from how it is performed; the mistakes that musicians make in playing the symphony do not compromise this fact."  This is a perfect analogy for competence and performance, but Chomsky's idea of competence is avowedly mentalist, while Saussure's construct of _la lange_ was socially determined in the Durkheimian sense.  Hymes conflates two cells of a four cell problem and then takes a position opposite his construction.  He retroactively mentalizes Durkheimian aspect of Saussure's _la lange_ into a psychological construct while simultaneously  inverting Saussure's construct of individually-willed speech acts, _actes de parole_, into a social construct.  With this revision made, Chomsky becomes simply a neo-structuralist, and both Chomsky and Saussure can be dispatched without engaging their contributions.

The book ought to be titled how monkeys hear the world--it mostly deals with comprehension ofr vocalizations.  could have dealt more with production? difficult to test.  Visual tests were meagre in positive evidence, providing mostly evidence that monkey's realm of operation was not at its best in ,visual domain.

lower brain as site of monkey vocal production
--Sey & Che say it is superceded
--but they dont deal w/ production
--only hearing:

--all articles)
--see also p 128.
--they deal only w/ production, and human analysis of normal productionx at that, in lower brain studies.  Macaque production in right hemisphere?

1:  WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A MONKEY?
--Fodor argues for a "lanfuage of thought" (1975) both represents the world and affects behaviour. p8.
--Markl's def of cognition= "the ability to relate different uncoinnected pieces of informationin new ways and apply the results in an adaptive manner p9
--representations are "images, rules, propositions or symbols that guide an organism's (or a machine's) behaviour p15-16
--Quine
--imaginary linguist tries to understand ali8en language from words using only words
--the more words available, the better he can relate them, but never know absolute meaning of them
--only their meaning in relation to other words
--"Non-human primates seem to be experts at analyzing each other's behaviour; they sem much worse at analyzing each other's thoughts." p174book asks  "how accessible is their intelligence? 'Do they understand how much they know?  
--metaknowledge
--reflexiveness
--do they know what they know
--do they have a "theory of mind?" are they able to attribute different states of mind to others and make predictions about others behaviour and actually manipulate it?  see pink card)  

2:  SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
--Robert Hinde
--"dep structure of dnon-human primate groupsrecognize kin, group relations hierarch and dominance partly basred on matriarchy
--triangulated lineage of clans
--oldes fem of oldest clan, but rank is fluid, not a state.
--groups defend trerrritory (actually, they defend the benefits of the territory)
--low rank disrupts families
--torn between striving for 'status through bonding w/ high ranks at gexpense of own kin and maintaining own kin ties p55
--admit that their observations may be anthropomorphic
--design tests to test this in cp 3 3:  SOCIAL KNOWLEDGEKnowing how vs knowing that
--latter is ability gto make declarative causal stastements about one's world. p 59Monkeys able to infer gfrom dyads social orders which they have not observed
--socially able to declare that"
--they represent social rel's in mind and compare them on basis of repr's--std rep--real
--exisatence of built-in categories? self-awareness of this? don't know..p97 

4:  VOCAL COMMUNICATION
Jimmy Connor's grunts
--intended or not?
--do monkey's intend to communicate?
--seemingly normal vocalizations could be elicited through elec stim of sub-cortical regions of brain associated w/ emotional expressions in humans" 
--as pointed out in lower section of cptr (120), humans can't auditorily tell difference \between one grunt and the next, although monkeys can
--perhaps swearing elicited by stim of human might sound like lang to monkeys!grasded vs discrete distinctions
--graded reality divided into discrete chunksa in human perception
--seems like vocalizations of monkeys are too.  Are the categories built in like voicing of /p/ ==>/b/ in infants?  is what is special about humans the ability to become aware of categories and make new ones to suit needs
--meta-categories
--as opposed to being stuck w/ hard-wired ones?  are monkeys able to manipulate an/d adapte and 'edit' their categories, or transfer info from one to next?  seems not.  Authors dont deal w/ awareness of abstraction of categories as a human tool
--don't consider the ability of making categories to be filled as opposed to filling hard-wired categories.  Authors addreess this obtusely
--some studies (Marler 1976a) 'clamim the ability to 'chunk' (my usage) graded stream of acoustic sounds is key to evolutionary transformation.  Sey & Ch say monkeys have passed this hurdle
--"we can easily explain why vervets have so many grunts [ie discrete categories (my brackets)] but we cannot explain why they have so few."-120.
--perhaps the discrete categories of perception are hard-wired and useful, although the vocalizations/prioduction can be graded. perhaps the ability to categorize new production
--ie manipulate the concept of categories
--would be the evolutionary hurdle (my thought.) 
--see Robinson, Physiological Behavior 2:345-54, 1967, Jurgens, et al, Experimental Brain Research, 4:114-7, 1967, Jurgens and Ploog, Exp BRain Res., 10: 532-34, 1970--all articles)--see also p 128.
--they deal only w/ production, and human analysis of ormal productionx at that, in lower brain studies.  
--"Finally, non-humanx primate vocalizations exhibit parallels with lang not only in social funct but also in the neural mech'sms tht underlie call perception.  In the one study carried out thus far, Jap Macaques, tested with their own species' vocalizations, show the same right ear advantage and localization of control in the anterior temporal cortex as humans"128 
--is this control of comprehension or production? 
--Full quote conflates production and comprehension (see emphases)
--"When humans discriminate between 'phonemes, two phenom. are apparent. First, when distinguishing different acoustic stimuliwe attend to some physical features while ignoring others (e.g. Ladefoed 1975).  Whern distinguishing between the gphonmems ba and pa for instance, we pay attention to differences in voice onset time, ignoring differ3ences in other acoustic jfeatures like jamplitude, speech rate, or the fundamental freq of the spkr's voice (Lisker & Abramson 1964).123-124  sort of obvious?
--also, "for most humans, perception of many linguistically relevan/t sounds [such as?] is sopecializedd in the left cerebral hemisphere, " so sjhow rt ear adv. when "distinguishing one sound from another" (see Bradshaw & Nettleton in Behav. Brain Sci, (1981) 4:51-91)
--until recently, laterralizarion could not be found in monkeys or apes
--test of Macaques showed phonemes w/in coos depended on one indicator
--in coos, 2 variables teste dwere initial freq. and temporal frequency peak of coo.  Jap macaques tested for sorting their own coos against another species along both variable.  when sort was by init freq, other spec did better! when bvy peak, macaques did better. p124 
--still all heard rather than uttered


--left hemispherectomy of macaques resulted in temporary but significant reduction in ability to distinguish coos.  right hemispherectomy had no such effect on comprehension.
--I think this shows higher order thinking(?), namely the ability to _produce_  meaningful coos.  This ability had to already know how to deal with the "lower order" (evolutionarily earlier?) job of comprehension, so that it could teach it over again. 

-- Are some aspects of Macaque production in right hemisphere?
--studies wh did not find lateral differernces in the "control of behaviour"
--(production?): Hamilton Annals of the NY acad of Sci., 299:222-32, 1977; Warren in Lateralization and handedness, S. Harnad et al eds. NY: Academic Press 1977
--lateralization fouhnd in Macaque tests: Zoloth et al. Science, 204:870-72, 1979; Petersen et al., Science, 202:324-327, 1978; Behavioral Neuroscience, 779-90, 1984; Penfield & Roberts Spch & Brain Mechanisms, NY:Athenium 1966(humans);Hefner & Hefner Science, 226:75-76, 1984
--syntax
--reject chomsky's definition of "sys of rulles wh. . . to produce ∞ # of sentences" b/c of "sentence" and "∞ #" parts
--instead, adopt "sys of rule wh allows prediction of signals"
--unnecessary reduction
--could just ⌂ "sentences" to "meaningful utterances" in N Chomsky's def. 
--they refuse to address infinity problem, but dthis is at the heart of syntax
--they have no way of determining order odf abstraction/reflexion in representation w/ their def
--Other provides this in a possibly testable form. p129
--leopard calls-elicit look uaround and flight up treee, eagle calls elicit look up and varied response dependent onm situation, python calls elicit bibedal scanning.
--there is division into pred and non pred at birth, also tererrestial, flying and snake-like division seems hard-wired.  Then they are fine-tuned (filtered by experience?) by learning.130
--see pink card for my version.
--prototype theory of object class not supported for monkeys
--learn that a non-pred. eagle close to same appearance as a predator eagle is not dangerous before learn that a more different appearing non-predotor eagle
--see nts by me in margin of -133
--adults second accurate alarms, ignore wrong alarms
--no active pedagogy135
--infants born with sloppy forms of grunts and alarms which are hard-wired but tuned/filtered by exp.
--cannot manipulate categorties like humans.
--"In vervet vocal development, as in [human] lang, comprehension precedes production." 137They learn other animals calls too5:  WHAT THE VOCALIZATIONS OF MONKEYS MEAN
--aithors act "as if" monjkeys do intend to communicate 
--it is direct and does not attribute mentraql staters to others-monkeys, if have intent, could be zero order intent
--have no  beliefs and desires; or  1st order, have 'em, but not aware of them,or 2nd or higher order
--have beliefs or knowledge about their beliefs and knowledge (higher
--beliefs about others beliefs...monkeys probably 1st order to 2nd order ..evidence
--no alarms when alonevervets have categories wired for functional typesd of predatores, but they load the categories accordingly
--if a former non-predator such as cheetahs began huinting vervets, as they do in Cameroion, then cheetahs would be added to the terrestial predator category
--stil not necessary to be aware of category, and no evidence of ability to manipulate category
--ie invent a new one170 

6:  SUMMARIZING THE MENTAL REPRESENTATIONSA OF VOCALIZATIONS AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
Monkeys need social representation evolutionarily, but alarms may remain non-abstracted to some degree
--although monkeys can represenmt, they cannot it appears draw analogies with similar situationslevels of attribution
--monkeys probably hve 1, maybe 2, probably not 3\/1: comprehend pattern of things to predict pattern of things2: comprehend pattern of action of animates to predict future patterns3: infer jmotives to 'other' animates to predict future 'other' internal states and future 'other' actions. 183 

7:  DECEPTION
They can lie--often by neglect 

8:  ATTRIBUTION
"theory of mind"
--Premack and Woodruff (1978)my take on developmental levels of children's theories of mind/ attribution posited on 208-9:

KEY: S: Self; δ: other; x: any parcel of mind where x ≥ 0
level 1: self as all:  			S ≈ δ;    
level 2: self as paragon/std:		S - x ≈ δ, S ≈ δ - x;   
level 3: others as selves:		[(S ± x ≈ δ ± x) (S not≈ δ)]
--monkeys do not clearly distinguish their own knowledge from that of others 213
--but apes may to some degree.  
--Monkeys show grief (stative), but not compassion (Behavioral) or empathy(attributive)
--Consciousness?? FOodor/Jackendoff
--computational modules
--domain speceficity
--often non-transferable
--difference gbetween self-awareness and consciousness 

9: SOCIAL AND NON-SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
--failure to recognize python tracks or carcasses stored by nearby leopard-modularity of monkey

10: HOW MONKEYS SEE THE WORLD
--"Apparently, monkeys see the world as composed of things that act, not things that think and feel.  Although they are acutely sensitive to other animals behaviour, they know little about the knowledge or motives that cause animals to do what they do."308

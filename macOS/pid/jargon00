**** Jargon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <state00>
In Siegel's definition, a jargon is an idiosyncratic means of communication that, if it survives, may stabilize into a pidgin or radically transform into a creole.  Jargons are what Bickerton is considering as the inadequate language input that helps set the stage for features of the bioprogram to emerge in subsequently formed creoles.  In the sense used by Siegel, the term is interchangeable with Bickerton's specialized sense of "pidgin" as an unstable, idiolectal, radically mixed contact language which emerges as the result of a particular set of social and demographic conditions.  Siegel says that pidginization results in a jargon, while Bickerton calls it a pidgin whether it is stabilized or not, and then says that he is concerned only with the unstable variety of pidgins.

creoles--the issue of prerequisite prior pidgins
hook to <socgum1.23> 
Alleyne, 1971, in Hymes; and Bickerton, Roots, challenge this on different grounds
Alleyne:
Bickerton: initially strong target acq as 2nd lang. until Event 1, after which pidginization happened on big scale in the more "radical" (fast onset of event one) areas.  History points to strong euro communities early on in plantation, which were preceded byan entirely diffedrernt "fort" dynamic in which Euros were as likely to learnthe particular African or Pacific target as vice versa (My note: although evidence points strongly toward african trade interpreters--only missionaries went to the trouble of learning the languages).  Pidgfinization is the breaking apart of coherent language models which makes necessary the emergence of the bioprogram for acquisition to take place.

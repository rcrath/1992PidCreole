THEO00~  'theoretical perspective'
absolute/relative--postmodernism, deconstruction, empiricism, science...


Most theories have a fixed, or independent variasble, in which lie assumptions and questions that shape the results of their application.  <fix00>  Multiple-perspective approaches can also be attempted, such as adopted here and in many reviews of corpuses(?) of scholarly literature <multi00>.  Perhaps the difference here is the effort made to explain the relations among different perspectives rather than accurately add to descriptive knowledge pursued from a singular perspective. <adeq00>

~MULTI00~
'might want to refer to the APPROACHES graph'
A multiple perspectives approach assumes <multi01> the viability of more than one viewpoint and seeks to explain ambivalence, contradiction, paradox and difference among approaches rather than using them as evidence for or against an isolated approach taken at a particular moment whose boundaries and assumptions are already privileged or denied as a precondition of acceess to the model. <adeq00>  A multiple perspectives approach recognizes the importance of fixed-point descriptions and explanations and in fact depends upon their being at least somewhat viable.  A multiple perspectives approach recognizes a tendency, perhaps a constraint, of being able to consciously operate from only one perspective at a time--serially.  One can go to Buffalo, New York City, and Novosibirsk, but not at the same time, and only from where one's present location is.  I like to think of this as the historical constraint, one that has ties to the way we represent our worlds and even to the nature of consciousness itself.   <memes00>

~MULTI01~
Besides assuming that a theory is at least somewhat viable, it also assumes that individuals have at least some capability for adopting more than one perspective.  As such, it is simply another singular perspective, subject to its own set of limitations, but which may through into relief different relations or structures.
~multi01~

~MEMES00~
Dennett posits a serial nature of consciousness of plural events--a sort of narrative of memes.  <Dennet00> Perhaps his concept of memes is an anthropomorphic reduction of the problem of individual and society--or perhaps it is the source of the problem.  Multiple perspectives approach does not seek to answer this as a "one or the other" solution--instead recognizing that the two cepts probably feed off on another. 
~memes00~

A multiple perspectives Approach seeks to add dimension and depth to understanding in a synthetic way, by serially shifting frames, tracking and analyzing the results.

~multi00~

This is different than deconstruction 
--(which rejects all approachews, while denying that this itself is an approach) and 
post-modernism, 
--which levels all approaches into arbitrary constructs imposed upon ineffable contents, ceding the possibility of absolute or real knowledge of the existence of ties between form and meaning.

Pidgin --a pragmatic definition

A pidgin is the linguistic means of communication in contact situations where no other common language is available to the communicating parties, whether as a result of linguistic or social constraints.  It can be negotiated and provisional, or it may be more traditional and set.  The form (or lack thereof) that a pidgin assumes at a particular moment is heavily dependent on its particular sociohistorical context.  Its function is limited to the communication requirements of the task at hand and is not the first language any of its speakers--if it were, it would by definition be something other than a pidgin.

Pidginization as second language learning

name this File = <pid-2nd.1>
uplink: pidginization def.

All pidgins are learned as second (or later) languages.  There are by definition no native speakers, and the form of the lect varies from one individual to the next.  Most pidgins remain as second languages with specialized functions, and the majority die as the circumstances which required their use change.  
{--sources: On pidgins as second languages, see Derek Bickerton, Dynamics of a Creole System, London: Cambridge University Press, 1975, 1-172, on idiolects, 18-19; also, ________, "Creole Languages," Scientific American, 249:1, July 1983, 116-121; 



When people acquire a second language, they never learn it quite as well as a native speaker.  No matter how long they speak it, they will always be recognizable as non-native speakers, given away by some slight pronunciation difference or misplaced stress.  Pidginization is the same process, but the language must be re-invented from what is available; there are no native speakers.  As a result, no one member can ever be quite at ease with the tentative music, language, or culture of the first generation.  

Though the processes are closely related, pidginization analytically precedes second language learning--the former cannot be arrived at by addition to the latter.  Both are attempts to acquire a second language, but in pidginization the target language is contested.


'Provisional or rule-based?'

pidgins--stability of 

Bickerton defines pidgins as provisional, changing and ad hoc systems (Roots of Language 5) rather than as more formalized, rule-based  systems, as others argue. (Holm 1:5).  

Siegel calls the provisional type a  "jargon" {<jargon00>}. 
Pidgins are a second, more rule-ordered stage <state00> that has
still not acquired as any speaker's native language {<inc> -
-define native lang, look at the idealization involved--
monolingual acq, all or nothing--issues of community continuum}

Others, perhaps Bickerton <Bickerton??>  foremost, use the
provisional stage as the definition of a "classical" pidgin.
{<inc> Get Bickerton} This is in line with the role he has
assigned pidgins in his bioprogram hypothesis. {<inc> gen?? or
bioprogram}

The more rule-based lects are favored as prototypical by many 
others.  

Many of the debates over what is and is not a pidgin are semantic
in nature.  Pidgins formed from the sudden dislocation of
populations seem to be more provisional early on.  If there is a
continued need for a pidgin, most  often because of continued
arrival of newcomers, it may stabilize somewhat.  <state00> This
is the type of lect that is most often used as counter-evidence 
to the idea of provisional pidgins. The explanations for the
differences most  often have more to do with sociohistorical
context than linguistic theory  per se.  The former acts as a
constraint upon any useful theory, but  often it is used to
reject an argument on the grounds of  real-world exceptions to
theoretical claims without  sufficiently exploring explanations
that synthesize rather  than pick sides. <sochst00>

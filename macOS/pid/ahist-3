___Disengagement and the foreclosure of synthesis________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist00 -result>

Though recent scholarship has recognized that both positions need to be reckoned within any systematic theory of pidgin and creole languages, the path toward synthesis remains tangled and obscured.  Current criticisms of generative paradigms in pidgin and creole studies often rest upon increasingly complex and not always tenable historical assumptions.  Having disposed of opposing theories by means of a faulty historical argument, critics often proceed to support their own positions with perfectly reasonable linguistic arguments.  By prematurely ruling out the opposing theory on non-linguistic grounds, the need to engage with contradictory positions is dismissed and the possibility of an adequate synthesis is hastily foreclosed.

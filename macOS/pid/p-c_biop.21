*The bioprogram explanation of monogenesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.2>

Bickerton's hypothesis rests on the occurence of a particular set of historical constraints of pidginization and creolization.  A displaced, linguistically heterogenous population negotiates provisional ways of communicating in order to meet particular exigincies--Bickerton's working model of a pidgin.  Children acquire their native languages with these unstable pidgins as input, yet build complete grammars (in the fullest linguistic scope of the term).  The resulting creole lect is less marked according to Bickerton, and therefore closer to the human language "bioprogram" than languages of more than a generation in age.  The features held in common among far-flung creoles which are inexplicable by models of contact and contagion are manifestations of the bioprogram.  {  Bickerton, Dynamics, 175-179, 54-60.

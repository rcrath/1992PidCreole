___Kupwar grammar as a koine____________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <socgum1.3 1 13>

The language siutuation in Kupwar becomes explicable once evidence of historical process is introduced in conjunction with their systemic analysis.  At the level of community delimited by Gumperz and Wilson, the Kupwar public grammar (though not its lexicons) is one which Siegel would describe as a stabilized, nativized koine that has not undergone expansion, similar to Guyanese Bhojpuri. <koidev00>  Siegel compares such koines with "creoloids"--varieties which Gumperz and Wilson would label as "creole-like" but not creoles for historical reasons, perhaps for the lack of a pidgin stage. <creoloid> Siegel differentiates these from pidgins and creoles because though the results of each formation process resemble each other, the means of arriving at those results differs drastically.  Those means reside in the domain dismissed by (and inaccessible to) Gumperz and Wilson, "the exact historical circumstances."

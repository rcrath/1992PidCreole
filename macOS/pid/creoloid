A "Creoloid" is a variety that has creole features, but has not developed from a pidgin.   Singlish, the basilectal English used in Singapore is the synecdochal example.  The superstrate target, English, provides the template with heavy multiethnic lexical borrowing making the language usefeul for interethnic communication.  Siegel questions whether it is a creolization process or not, because it is not a nativized language.  He considers it to be stabilized, perhaps expanded, but non-nativized pidgins. <piddev00>

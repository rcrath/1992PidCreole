The importance of point of view  
     Of what importance is point of view of the researcher?  Point of view is assigned by the author.  The perspective that the author assigns is assumed to be the best one to take, whether for the job at hand, or for all purposes.  It establishes who the agent <level01.cog> is, who is able to do what to whom <pow1 1 7> in the author's model.  The point of view that an author assigns has repercussions throughout the study, from collection of data, observation methods, interpretation, and results.  Although it assigns a _subject_ of study, which perhaps is the agent in grammatical constructions, scholarly writing conventions generally mask the ultimate and absolute agent in any writing, the author.  The traditional subject is the author's object or theme; it is acted upon by the author's writing of it rather than acting of itself as the author would wish to write it in the scientific hope of becoming himself transparent and presenting the "objective truth."  Often an internally congruent system will contradict another internally congruent system because the authors have transparently adopted differing agent positions and let the data "speak for itself."  One of the points of thais project is to show how this has happened in creole studies, with the result that positions that are perhaps complementary from a multiple perspectives approach end up needlesly refuting each other on specious grounds.  this obscures constructive criticisms and makes the possibility of synthetic thinking get lost in ad hominem arguments and taboos.

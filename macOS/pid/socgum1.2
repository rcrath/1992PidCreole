___Creolization and convergence_________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <socgum01>
--  Perhaps Gumperz's most cited work is his and Robert Wilson's
    study of language contact and convergence in Kupwar village
    in southern India.                              <socgum1.21>

 -- Adopting a synchronic analysis, the authors state that
    "there seems to be no reason ... to draw an _a priori_
    distinction among pidginization, creolization and other
    diffusion processes."{<inc>                     <socgum1.22>

 -- Their findings are partly contingent upon a definition of
    creolization that requires a pidgin as its starting point.

 -- They also assert that in Kupwar village, home languages are
    "re-syntactified" for public use rather than re-lexified, as
    many creolization models would predict.         <socgum1.24>

 -- However, their approach cannot discern which of the two
    processes is operant  without the introduction of historical
    evidence and a concept of language independent of its
    speakers.                                       <socgum1.25>

___Kupwar and Atlantic Creoles_________________________________

In Kupwar, the superstrate power group at the level of the village is the linguistic substrate in public interactions at the level of the region, where _Marathi_ is the superstrate language. The fact that this regional superstrate is also the local substrate of most importance in Kupwar village is significant to understanding the language situation that Gumperz and Wilson study.  _Marathi_ is exerting both superstrate and substrate influence in Kupwar.  Atlantic Creoles, on the other hand never have languages that act as both substrate and superstrate unless perhaps the European language is excluded from analysis and community is defined exclusively in terms of interactions among African ethnicities.  Although the varieties in Kupwar and the Atlantic world may share similarities both of process and in results, their histories are radically different.  An analysis that cannot account for these differences cannot be considered an adequate sociolinguistic explanation anymore than a diachronic explanation that cannot explain synchronic variation.

Without the island effect, point of view becomes crucial in using aggregate statistics.  In early Virginia, for example, the population was mostly white and the economy was mixed between plantation and subsistence enterprises.  From the regional point of view, or from the perspective of most whites, cultural demography would appear to follow the most gradual lines.  Event one would seemed never to have happened, therefore no Virginia creole would appear to have existed.  What this aggregate perspective misses is that from the perspective of an African American, whether enslaved or free, most other people of African descent lived in isolated, black-majority communities.  The reason for this was that the majority of Africans were enslaved on plantations that held bound twenty or more slaves.  Thus while most "citizens (i.e. "whites")" owned none, one or two slaves, most slaves lived on plantations.  For this reason, Bakers' and Corne's model needs to be applied in explicitly defined communities if littoral perimeters do not tacitly do this.

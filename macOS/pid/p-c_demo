**** Demography, pidginization, creolization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mat>
     Baker and Corne cite three demographic "events" that
partially determined the extent and timing of pidginization and
creolization in Reunion and Isle de France, islands in the Indian
ocean east of Madagascar.  The "events" (quotation marks are the
authors') are:

" 1. when the number of slaves, who included several different
     ethnic groups speaking unrelated languages, surpassed the
     number of members of the 'ruling class;'
  2. when the number locally-born slaves surpassed the total
     number of members of the rulihng class (both foreign- and
     locally-born);
  3. when the regular supply of slave immigrants came to an end."
     
I find these "events" valuable as a heuristic device, but the
actual processes involved were surely graded rather than
discrete, and tempered or exacerbated by other factors as well.

(Kay 1983) <bib.bib -Kay>
"Linguistic Competence and Folk Theories of Language: Two English
Hedges"  

a Hedge is a meta-comment about the language that the speaker is
deploying.  

Kay says it needs to be incorporated into theories of semnantics. 

He raises the idea of "folk theories" of language, which he
conmtrasts with "conscious theories."  He borrows the concepts
fropm anthropologists.  Items in the lex. according to this,
express their meaning in anb ordered way that reflects a tacit
streucturing of the conceptuasl world.  In this, Hedges will
reveal a folk theory of language. Furthermore, he thinks this
might be part of "knowledge OF language," ie linguistic
competence, as distinguised from "knowledge ABOUT language" (i.e
folk theories ratherr than genetic endowments) as part of
knowledge of the world. (129-130)


His distinctionbetween folk and conscious theory is facile--What
is global?  --What the "conscious" theorists study!  How do they
know its global? Because that is what they study!  What of
consistencies that the conscious theorists are not copnscious of?
They don't count!

    Folk                          Conscious
local consistency                  local consistency
no global consistency required     global consistency

The two hedges he studies are "Loosely speaking" and
"Technically."

128-129:
He says "when someone says, _Loosely speaking, France is
hexagonal_, part of what they have uttered is a certain kind of
comment on the locutiuon, _France is hexagonal_."  It is about
the world which the utterance is about rather than the contents
of the utterance.  This has traditionaly been handled by
pragmatics rather than semantics, but Kay questions the
reality/efficacy of the division.  

137:Hedges, he says are a folk theory that hads infiltrated
conscious theories via hedges.  They are used rather than
believed or not.

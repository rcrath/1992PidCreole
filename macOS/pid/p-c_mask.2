**** Calquing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mask>
To calque is to blend exterior morphemes from one language in a way that translates the conceptual form of another.  Calquing requires knowledge of two or more languages.   An example would be the creolized term _ai wata_, which is analogous to the Yoruba expression _omi oju_, meaning "eye water" -- i.e. "to cry."

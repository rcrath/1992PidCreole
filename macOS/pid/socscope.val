    Hymes mentions "Validity" as the other key to Labov's work. 
By attempting to gather more random samples than previous
dialectologists, Labov revolutionized that field.  He has been
subsequently criticized for not following through with
statistical tests of the reliability of his sample, data and
conclusions (although such tests do not radically temper or even
alter Labov's findings).  While important in their own right,
Labov's contributions in this regard are tangential to the
subject.

**** Superstrate 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <strata00>
In situations of language contact, the superstrate is the language native to the group with the most power.  In Atlantic-based creoles this is generally the European language.  A closely related term is the "target" language, because it is assumed that pidgin and creole languages are aimed at becoming the European language.  Early theories of pidgin and creole genesis often assumed that pidgins were either made from dialectal features of European languages that had since fallen into desuetude or flawed attempts at acquiring the European language.  Theories in this regard ranged widely.  Some thought the pidgins and creoles to be a conventionalized  "foreigner talk" -- a simplified register used to communicate with foreigners.  Charles Ferguson has produced some important work in this area.  The most prominent role for the superstrate in recent theory is as the "relexifier" language.  Most of the pidgin or creole vocabulary is drawn from the superstrate and framed on a pan-regional West/Central African system according to this theory.  This hypothesis has proven responsive to criticism and flexible enough to continually resurface as an explanatory device.

**** Perspectives -- Two dominant themes

--Sociolinguistic                                         <soc00>
One approach ascribes consistent viewpoints or repertoires of viewpoints to specific communities in order to describe the methods and uses of communication within a particular domain in a locally congruent fashion.  
--Generative                                              <gen00>
The other approach assigns point of view to an idealized and universalized individual and seeks to explain the "mental language" that individuals use to represent their thoughts, actions and beliefs in any particular language.

The following are the issues addressed by both <soc00> and
<gen00>:  
{<inc> What are the origins of each approach? }
{<inc> How has each approach affected pidgin and creole studies?
    --review the field
{<inc> What, in their own estimation, do each approaches share?
    ie, How do they see their own field and mission?}
{<inc> -- What are the assumptions and methods used to study this
    way?  What is privileged?}
{<inc> What effects result from employing this approach in its
    strong form?  (only get part of the picture)}

--Possibilities become events:
                                                 <ahisyn1 -poss>

An ethnographic present, because it is a past event, can dispose of any irrealis function markers such as "possible to"  or "able to."

In this way, a statement of the irrealis domain of a
relationship, such as: 
    "The type of relations between the entities made it possible      for them to interact in particular ways"
becomes:
    The result of the relationship was that one entity could AND      DID interact with another in a particular way.

As the example in the section on power relations illustrates, however, this is the result of disaggregating the possibilities available to all the participants in the relationship, somthing that can only be done be hindsight to an artificially collapsed block of time.                           {<inc> Union of sets...}

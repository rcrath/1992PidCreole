Pike on the problems of interpreting synchronically-described
clusters:  

         In the process of change from one phonemic system     
to a differnt phonemic system of the same language,
    there may be a time during which parts of the two
    systems exist simultaneously and in conflict within the     
speech of of singlew individuals. . . . It is
    impossible to give a purely synchronic description of a     
complex mixed system, at one point in time, which shows      the
pertinent facts of that system; directionm of 
    change is a pertinent characteristic of the system and     
must also be known if one wishes to have a complete
    descriptipon of the language as it is structurallly
    constituted

                        --from Fries and Pike (1949),
"Coexistent Phonemic Systems" quoted from 161 of Weinrich, Labov,
and Herzog in Lehmann, _Directions..._ (full cite on 190)

This quote can be generalized through paraphrase by using
"culture" for "language" and Pike's back formation of "emic" from
"phonemic": 
    In the process of change from one emic system to a
    different emic system of the same culture, there may be     
a time during which parts of the two systems exist
    simultaneously and in conflict within single
    individuals. . . . It is impossible to give a purely
    synchronic description of a complex mixed system, at
    one point in time, which shows the pertinent facts of
    that system; directionm of  change is a pertinent
    characteristic of the system and must also be known if     
one wishes to have a complete description of the
    culture as it is structurallly constituted

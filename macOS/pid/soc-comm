*How linguistic communities are defined 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <soc_vs_.ref>

Gumperz and Labov both provide fairly explicit models of how to define a community for linguistic analysis.  Labov favors defining the community first on non-linguistic grounds and then etically analyzing the language continua that take place within that community.  Taboret-Keller and Lepage look for natural communities.  In contrast, Gumperz defines community by speech and considers social differences as a function of speech community membership.  These preferences are partly grounded in a reaction to the generativist idealization of the speech community.

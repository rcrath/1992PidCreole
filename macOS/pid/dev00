    In Mülhäusler's synthesis of stages <state00> and processes, <proc00> (adopted by Siegel) he considers two related developmental cycles, one for pidgins and creoles and another for koines. In addition, the concepts of decreolization and language death can be considered within his general framework in some circumstances.

For the distinctions between the processes of pidginization or creolization and pidgin or creole languages see Jeff Siegel, _Language Contact in a Plantation Environment: A Sociolinguistic History of Fiji_ (Cambridge, 1987), 16-17.   
Peter Mülhäusler, _Pidgin and Creole Linguistics_.  London: Basil Blackwell: 1986, 134-251.  The process of development is one of the main themes of recent, especially Pacific Creole studies according to Jourdan ("Blurring of Categories").

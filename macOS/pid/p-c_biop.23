**** Diverting issues in the bioprogram debates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.2>

Bickerton's hypothesis requires dealing with the historical context of creolization rather than with its product--a creole language--alone.  He assigns perspective to individuals operating within temporal and societal possibilities.  He is primarily concerned with a particularly strong form of creolization that he labels "classical."  Two tangential factors have generated much of the controversy around his position, diverting attention from the problem of accounting observations that point toward monogenesis.  The first is his narrowing of the definition of the process of creolization; The second, the confusion by many of his critics of the process (creolization) with its result (a creole language which itself may undergo different processes)

**** Creoles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <state00>
There are two widely held positions, each claiming a slightly different definition of what a creole language is: the substratist and bioprogram approaches, respectively.  While they have a common core of languages that both agree are creoles, there are large domains in each definition that do not overlap with the other.  Some of the issues can be cleared up by clarifying the locus of creole agency as in its speaker rather than in a "language."  This is a problem of individual and aggregate data and scholarly attitudes toward that data.

Aphasia and Prosody in comprehension--as opposedc to production
{<inc> look at production/comprehension issues}

--literature on production (fairly extensiver) gives impression
that prosody is early acquired and resistant to loss.
--very little literasture on prosody and comprehension
--his test shows no effect on prosodic comprehension in non-
aphasics w/rt hemisphere damage, with increasing difficulty in
comprehension of prosody in left aphasics correlated with
severity of aphasia.  Comprehension of manageable language tasks
is improved by addition of prosodic elements.  Tasks too
difficult for the aphasic are not made easier and perhaps made
harder by the addition of prosaodic or other supra segmental
elements.

(right aphasics--difficulty in antonymy, dealing with figures of
speech, contextual clues (drawing the moral from the story for
eg._)--in some ways similar to Wernicke's aphasics (left), who
suffer severe semantic difficulties {<inc> }From Clark, etal
Language--intro readings, quoting Heny quoting Gardner etal}
contrastive strees is communicative--Hoew is it processed
(Wernicke's area? Broca's? Angular Gyrus?...)

--prosody may counteract noise Whether auditory or from brain
damagfew) in the sysstem moreso than play representing role.

"features such as contrasdtive stress convey not only a speaker's
affect and attitude, but also a part of the core of his message,
and that even severely impaired aphasic individualks retain the
ability to comprehend the linguisitic as well as the
paralinguistic information that prosody conveys."(253)

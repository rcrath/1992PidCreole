'origins of universals vs substrate positions, 1878-1883'
    Adolpho Coelho, a Portuguese philologist, was the first to
posit a universalist origin for creoles, claiming in 1878 that
processes of simplification inherent to second language learning
were the primary cause of any linguistic distinctiveness creoles
might claim.  His position, which allowed for no substrate
influence whatsoever, was countered by Lucien Adam's 1883
assertion of an equally strong substratist position, maintaining
that francophone creoles had relied on French for their lexicons
but kept intact as much of the substrate grammar and phonology as
possible. {<inc> Holm88} 27-29)  The terms of a second debate
that is still underway had been set, this time along a somewhat
specious dichotomy between substrates and universals as the two
opposed explanations for differences between creoles and their
lexifiers.

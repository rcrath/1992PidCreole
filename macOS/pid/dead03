**** Language Death and Universals--Aphasia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <dead00>
Working from evidence of child language and aphasics, Lisa Menn begins her article with a critique of Jakobson's construct of an implicational phonemic hierarchy, noting that Children are gaining, and aphasics losing, phonetic information as well.  She then notes the morphological errors made by aphasics along both syntagmatic (nearby in structure) and paradigmatic (nearby in meaning) lines.  She then discusses differences between fluent and disfluent aphasics and the implications for processing.  She points out that this is a difference between the processing of logical form, in which order and function words are not primary, and articulation, in which ordering and relationship among words must be specified ion a serial chain.  This, she points out, is a different set of errors, requiring previously known information, in aphasics than those which occur in children.  Aphasics do not over-generalize to produce forms the way that children do.

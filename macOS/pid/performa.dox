Performadox:

a performative clause reperesenting the intended illocutionary
force is necessary in the deep structure of any sentence.  It has
"I" as subject and "You" as indirect object and the verb is the
only performative verb in the sentence.  It can be deleted
underthe correct grammatical conditions (most of them!).  The
deletion does not change the meaning.  

If this is true, adverbial hedges, such as "confidentially" in 
    1) Confidentially, the boss is a moron. 
don't  mean anything.  If it is not true, they are
unexplaininable in terms of what they modify. 

The first source performadox is (Boër and Lycan 1980)
<bib.bib -boër> "A Performadox in Truth Conditional Semantics,"
in _Linguistics and Philosophy_ 4:71-100.

Proposed solutions are concerned with different levels of
semantic truth.

    Once they define Kupwar as the unit of study, Gumperz and Wilson find that the only shared feature comes not from any standard language, but from the "creole-like" grammar shared by all three public varieties to allow word-for-word translations.  They contend that in local public language situations a common grammar, simplified toward _Marathi_, is lexified with unchanged morphs from multiple lexifier languages.  The authors maintain that historical approaches employed by many creolists (by which they mean specifically genealogical approaches) would describe the interactive varieties of _Kannada_, _Marathi_ and _Urdu_ as deviants from their respective standard languages while missing the feature they all share of word-for-word translatability onto a common "creole-like" grammar derived by simplification in the direction of _Marathi_.

**** Polygenesis, early
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <poly_vs_.mon>

    Robert Hall, taking a polygenetic approach, wrote some of the most important work of the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Hall had established himself as a scholar of Romance literature before his interests gradually led him into creole studies.  He used evidence from creoles to critique the validity of glottochronology as a measure of a normal rate of lexical change. He thought all creoles belonged genetically to the their superstrate family, with an influence exerted by the substrate as well as the sociological conditions of formation. ({<inc> holm88} 43-44)

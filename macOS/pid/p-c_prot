**** Prototypical vs. necessary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <taxono00>
Debates over the definition of a pidgin or creole are often concerned with the lack of a prototypical feature in a category privileged as "necessary" by a particular author.  Synthesis requires a flexible definition.  Using the concepts of prototype and family resemblances, preferred -- rather than necessary --  features can define pidgins and creoles in a way that positively defines them and simultaneously distinguishes them from related phenomena.  The particular forms a variety takes (whether pidgin, creole, or something else yet again) may stray from the prototype somewhat and many will include additional features concerned with their sociohistorical manifestations.  The prototype is essential only insofar as it is a way of momentarily bounding a category's parameters to allow definition.

 -- Definition considered as a cognitive concept....<cogcpt.map>

**** Monogenetic theories, rationale and typology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_mono.1>

Monogenetic theories of pidginization and creolization are the most plausible way to explain similarities in the structures of widely divergent pidgins and creoles.  Two types are current today, those which posit the relexification of some core grammar, and those which claim creole languages to be a special case of language formation.  Relexification hypotheses have made important contributions to creole studies, but are lacking in their overall explanatory capacity.  'Special case' arguments also have a long history in creole studies, and form part of the rationale for the study of pidgins and creoles as distinct from other languages.  The most controversial of these is Derek Bickerton's bioprogram hypothesis.

  WWW

  The WWW was a new thing in 1989, and it was not clear it would 
  be a success at first. The first widely used browser, still 
  useful and maintatined today, was the University of Kansas Lynx 
  browser, released in 1992, a year before Mosaic -- and a couple 
  before Netscape -- began the ascent of the graphical web. Gopher, 
  created in 1991, was a contender to beat the WWW approach but was 
  too structured to last.  But the internet was slow! <300Baud>.

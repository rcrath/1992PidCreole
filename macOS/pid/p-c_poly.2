**** Polygenesis, problems with ---
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_poly.1>

The observation of widespread common features of creoles has undermined any strong polygenetic approach.  They leave too many similarities among far-flung creoles to be explained by chance.  Even varieties that had no possibility of contact with each other, such as the Chinook Jargon used among Pacific Northwest Indians, and Krio, a West African creole, have similarities in their structures which cannot be ignored.  Polygenetic explanations are nonetheless attractive for a number of reasons.

3) Mintz and Price

The scholarship generated by Mintz & Price has utilized linguistic models, both social and generative, in framing an approach to studying African American cultural transfer.  They have helped shape the historical debates on African culture in the Americas for the past two decades with their search for "deep structures" of values and beliefs which generated new material culture in the Americas.  Their model, however, is concerned with these "deep structures" and how they explain changes and similarities wrought in material culture in the process of transfering cultures to new situations.  They do not consider the cultural aspects of the transformations, however, only the structures.  They consider transformations only implicitly and indirectly, and then only as a change in the mechanism which produces material culture from underlying values and beliefs.  In other words, their transformation is a derivative of the generative transformation, it is a change in the transformation rather than the transformation itself.  The latter remains unexamined.

Sidney Mintz and Richard Price set out a compelling argument for their model of culture formation in the New World.  They believe that the connecting of a particular New World culture with a particular African locale is an exercise in futility.  They point out that the groups of Africans who came over were not a homogenous lot.  Many of the different people who found themselves together in slavery in the New World would have been at war with each other in Africa.  They were not a cultural group, but rather a "crowd."  In order to have a culture, they had to build it--but that is not to say they had to build from scratch from European and New World sources to the exclusion of African sources, as Frazier would contend.  But neither could a crowd of culturally diverse people feasibly be believed to have chosen one particular area of a vast continent from which a minority of the crowd were drawn, and then decide amongst themselves to base their culture on the past experience of that particular minority element of the crowd.  No group can transfer their culture whole.  A model which posits a particular cultural origin for a New World tradition ignores the actual process taking place.  It is making the evidence fit the model rather than constructing a model from the evidence.  Thus the idea of continuities and retentions put forward by Herskovits is as untenable as Frazier's argument.

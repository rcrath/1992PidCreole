___Constraints on temporal possibilities_________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist-6 -limits>

If a theory cannot operate within diachronic constraints, it must be considered lacking no matter how internally consistent.  Historicity is constrained by the temporally possible rather than the rational or logical.  It is explanatory rather than predictive.  If evidence of both generative and sociolinguistic paradigms is found, it seeks to explicate the reasons why rather than dismiss one or the other.  This mutually supportive approach is precisely the one called for in recent work.  It is here that history has something to offer in return for the important, if perhaps ironically made, contributions of creolists to historiography.

___The concept of generations____________________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist00 -illustration>
The most prevalent (and contentious) areas of tacit ahistoricism in pidgin and creole studies concern the ways that individuals and communities act through time, especially in relation to the concept of generations.  When speech communities are treated as individuals the boundaries between immigrant (pidgin or second language speaking) and native (creole or first language speaking) become amorphous.  While a useful reduction, the notion of generations cannot be applied literally to speech communities unless all the members thereof can be unambiguously designated as such and give birth and die in unison.  Nonetheless, individuals can be reasonably located, with a minimum of ambiguity, as being either immigrant or native to a particular speech community even as the membership and speechways of the composite change through time.  Most of the seeming contradictions between creolists who recognize discrete generations and those who claim that pidgins and creoles merge imperceptibly into each other, if they can be differentiated at all, are traceable to this set of reductions.  One recent work that does not succumb to this tendency is Jeff Siegel's Language Contact in a Plantation Environment: A Sociolinguistic History of Fiji, in which he systematically distinguishes "stages" from "processes" in the developmental patterns of pidgins, creoles, and koines.  He provides the most historically adequate descriptive model to date.

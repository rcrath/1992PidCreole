**** Narratives as a poor source for verb markings -- Gullah
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_sea1.isl>

Most examples of Gullah speech used for linguistic analysis come from stories and narratives, in which the verbs are less inflected.  This verb construction is in some ways analogous to the historical present in English, where once it is established that the event or process being described took place in the past, then the present tense may be used, even though the time reference is to the past.  The idea of un-inflected verbs as an Africanism is so ingrained that Patricia Jones-Jackson, who is one of the few to provide non-narrative textual sources of Gullah speech, repeats the traditional stance of uninflected verbs right after describing their inflection patterns.  Gullah and other creoles deal with time reference and aspect through the use of markers such as ben, de and don which are not attached to the verb and precede rather than follow it (see <p-c_sea3.isl>).

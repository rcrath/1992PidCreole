**** Debate between substrate and univeral positions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <?????????> What would happen if sociolinguists applied their methodology to  Pidgin and creole studies?  
Bickerton's work has been shunned or rejected by most pidgin and creole scholars.  It has found more acceptance among  cognitive scientists and theoretical linguists.  {<inc> --  Jackendoff, Review in NYT Rev of Bks, Beh. and Br sci forum}  Besides creolists: anthropologists, sociologist and historians  have been among the least receptive to B's ideas. Joyner ignores,  	Gwendoly Hall rejects, Jourdain dismaisses, (latter two accept  Holm as unproblematic), Goodman dismisses with faulty historical  arguments, Mufwene turns a theory into an assertion,...{<inc> --  get sources--perhaps insert hypertext summaries of each argument  after my assertions}  
Perhaps much of the resistance is sociohistoric in its  origin, an irony lost on the socio-centric.  The strong version  of Bickerton's hypothesis, which he does not even hold in  hypothetical form, much less assert as truth {<inc>--give  examples} holds the possibility of bio-determinism.  This broad  concept has had a particularly nasty history, ranging from  hierasrchalizing of races classes and genders to justifications  of eugenics and genocide in the contexts of Nazi Germany, Western  
European colonialism and North American extermination and systems  of exclusion and privilege.   Social scientists have constructed  Bickerton's appplication and provisional testing of Chomsky's  theoretical positions as rank bio-determinism, as such dismissing  it out of hand, often on the basis of scurrilous historico-  statistical grounds.    
The sociological context of a field full of scholars  knocking down an effigy of their opponent, who has in the  meantime ceased to engage in the bouts and moved to the  grandstands of the particular arena, has its own implications,  too long unexamined.  If Bickerton's theory is so easily  dismissed, why must it be done with such virulence and so often  and in such a distorted a manner as to result in the author's  withdrawal from the discussion?  Perhaps it is the vehemence with  which Bickerton stated his position, especially the unfortunate  ressurection of one of Robert Hall's terms, _substratomaniac_, as  a descriptor of that to which he was offering an alternative  vision.  Hall's label is invoked more often than Bickerton's  vision, which has largely been inverted to ad hominem attacks on  its author in the guise of scholarship. {<inc> --get WMQ quotes  for this}  
If the withdrawal signifies defeat, why are so many current  works concerned with flogging the corpse?  Why have not people  working in other disciplines noticed that they are employing a  dead letter to such good effect?  What is the sociological  analysis of a game in which one team has left the field and the  other team keeps playing?  Perhaps it could be explained by  invoking universals of good sense.

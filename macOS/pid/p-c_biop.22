*The nexus of generative and sociolinguistic models 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <p-c_biop.2>
Is the bioprogram hypothesis alone enough to explain creole genesis?  Few including Bickerton would make such a claim, although it is often attributed to him.  The socio-historical factors of creole culture formation provided an environment from within which Bickerton proposes the bioprogram to partially emerge in the grammars of first generation creole speakers.

Applying generative grammar........................<p-c_biop.221>
 -- The bioprogram draws upon Chomsky's generative grammar for 
    its theoretical frame, but applies it to actual speakers.

In conjunction with sociohistorical context........<p-c_biop.222>
 -- The bioprogram is not exclusive of social effects 

As a matrix of representation and communication....<p-c_biop.223>
 -- It emerges from within the matrix of representation and 
    communication only when historical agents are considered.

Creoles, not pidgins, the locus of the bioprogram..<p-c_biop.224>
 -- The bioprogram is manifested in creoles, while pidgins are 
    negotiated social constructions.

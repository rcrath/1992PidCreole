___Synchrony and the constraints of time_________________________
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <ahist00 -So>


The strands of temporal narrative are obscured when individuals performing particular actions at specific times are lumped into an aggregate or when diachronic processes are analyzed as a synchronous mass.  The intentional stance of historical actors is lost.  At any particular moment, individuals may be assumed to be seeking to "make sense" of their world in their thoughts and actions.  Communities and statistical aggregates, though they may generate discernable patterns and correlations, cannot be granted such purposiveness and agency.  Often, the conclusions that can be rationally drawn from aggregate data correlations cannot be sustained once the constraints of time--unidirectionality and the unknowable nature of future events--are imposed.

     Labov approaches his object of study with the goal of
critiquing the neogrammarian/structuralist dichotomy between an
idealized psychological language and language as spoken and used.
                                                   <soclab01.01>
    The goals of intuitive approaches necessitate their
inability to explain why language changes, an important
theoretical question known as the "actuation problem.
                                                   <soclab01.02>
    To solve the actuation problem, Labov proposes to study the
"mechanism of change" by correlating linguistic variation to
social variation.

    While both his correlations and causal explanations are
often convincing, he, like anyone else building a model, has to
make assumptions or idealizations.

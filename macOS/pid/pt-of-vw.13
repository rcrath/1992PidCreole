**** Synchronic and diachronic evidence, local/global problems 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UP: <pt-of-vw.1>
Synchronic approaches make trends of particular perspectives and moments, which are often generalized in a way unwarranted by historicist criteria.  For example, colonial American planters might have recognized "a pidgin" (although they would not label it as such) as anything that was not their own English, putting a single label on everything "other-than" their own, glossing over a diversity that did not matter to them, but did to its speakers (or on the level of culture, bearers).  At the same time, Africans of different ethnicities also needed a common mode of verbal communication among themselves. <tertia00> The variety used could be an African or European language pidginized in an African or a European way and understood along the same lines.  Different analyses of the situation will be obtained depending upon how the boundaries of group, language, time, and individual are drawn.

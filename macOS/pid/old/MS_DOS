  DOS
  
  Most people, myself included, had little use for graphics anyway, 
  since DOS was king.  Apple had its niche and had better graphics, 
  but windows was still a novelty: slow, buggy, and resource intensive.  
  If you needed to get work done and had a budget of less than a couple 
  thousand bucks, DOS running WordPerfect 5.1 was the tool of choice. 
  But, if you believed the early Digital Humanities scholars (then 
  called humanities computing), We were all going to be reading and 
  writing <hypertx> in all its non-linear glory sooner rather than later.

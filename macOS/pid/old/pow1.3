A perfect definition is unobtainable

It is only in the past tense, only when power has already
been expressed through the relationship, that the domain and
its contents can be accurately assigned to particular
entities and actions.  But power expressed alters the power
relations in the expression instantaneously, making the
answer to the question "What are power relations?"
descriptively approachable, but ultimately unobtainable.

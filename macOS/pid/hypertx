  Hypertext
  
  Hypertext was the hot new thing among scholars and developers in the 
  early 1990s, and several came on the market in various formats that 
  were meant to be used locally rather than connected to web servers 
  and the Internet. 

  The idea was that hypertext would replace word processing and linear 
  text. The system used for this project   was made by a single quirky 
  developer, Neil Larson. The program to make the hypertext was sold 
  for a fee along with a complicated thesaurus-making program, but 
  the viewer, HYGEN, was free. HYGEN is the browser you are now on. 
  The reason for this project to still be worth looking at nearly 
  thirty years later is <speed>

Notes on vision, truth, philosophy
April 13, 1994

I just walked home through the rain, from campus. At the corner of Bedford St and South St., at a traffic light, I saw a cab drive past me at about thirty MPH as I waited for the light to change.  As it approached me, I read lettering on the side.  Being car-less, cab company names are of habitual, though slight, interest to me.  First, I recognized that it was an unfamiliar name. Then, I fixed the beginning of the lettering, which of course was approaching me like a tangent line does a circle. I made out "A-something", perhaps an "r"... as the cab proceeded past at 30 MPH, I moved my gaze forward at whayt must have been greater than 30MPH for an instant and took in "Cab" all at once, then got the end of the previous word, "son," which immediately yielded "Arson" with the center unverified.  This struck me as an odd thing to be printed on the side of a car, so I rechecked it, fixing "Ar" and "son" I found that there was a middle to this moving object, and that the cab had printed on it "Aronson" not "Arson," yielding "Aronson Cab" to my consciousness at the time the cab passed through the "tangent point" of the scenario.  Satisfied with my inquiry, and with no more lettering in view, I crossed the street as the light changed.  The whole fixing of "Aronson Cab" as an object with a particular length took less than two seconds, derived from a tangentially approaching moving object whose velocity may have been changing as I scanned it.  Some cab drivers might speed up to get through a light,  others might slow down.  Speed was not part of my conscious concerns, though I necessarily made calculations of it.  
Having written the preceding paragraph, I took a moment to look up "Aronson Cab" in the phone book.  It is not there.  There are several business listings for Aronson, but none of them cabs--perhaps I read Aronson and imagined cab, though I do not think so.  There was also an "Arlington Cab" in the phone book, which begins with "Ar" and ends with "on," but even though the veridical evidence I now have militates against "Aronson Cab," that is what I read.   My phone book is last year's, perhaps it is a new cab company.  I will call directory assistance shortly, but someone is on the line at the moment.
It is only upon a rather artificial reflection that issues of truth even impinge themselves on the matter.  I did not think the "Arson Cab" was false--I thought it was an odd name to be printed on a car, leading me to cut finer in my inquiry.  But perhaps, like issues of truth-judging, the oddity of "Arson" being printed on the side of a car had no antecedent causal effect upon my "inquiry" at all.  It may be only in my reflection now that I attribute any effectiveness to my momentary conscious reactions to the lettering.  It is entirely possible that if the company name were "really" "Arondon Cab" that I would never have consciously reflected, even for an instant, upon the intermediate stage producing "Ardon."  If this is so, perhaps there are other stages, or more likely, some continuous process, that is only segmentewd so finely under particular circumstances, and perhaps only epiphenomenonally, with my inquiry actually only being a constructed explanation attributing agency to my perceptions in hindsight.  
Other issues of truth can be dealt with while the phone line is tied up.  Oh--the line is clear--There, I called: No Aronson Cab is in the area I live in.  Perhaps it was Arlington, though I do not think so--There is an "s" in "Arson" but not in "Arlington."  More likely, it was an independent driver without his own phone listing (I am assuming gender, I paid no attention to the driver as the car passed by).  There is no need for me to draw on truth or even verificationism, though I have done the latter to extend the point well beyond my interests in transportation.  At each point I have simply extended and constrained my inquiry.  There is no need to invoke true/false distinctions--I just assume "true" at all points, with the principle that "true" may change continuously.  Falsity is not even entertained.  It would take too long.  Only in hindsight is it even possible to affix judgments about the falsity of my beliefs about the lettering, or whether I am mistaken.  What I saw was true at each and every instant--it could not be otherwise, and in fact, this is crucial to the ability to reflect upon the "truth" and "falsity" of past events at all.  This is what the philosopher's search for truth amounts to.  Of course, the truth of the futute is an absurd inquiry.  The truth of the past isa subject5 to judgment is subject to testing and reflection upon.  The truth of the present just is.  It is the only leverage that anyone has to make judgments about the truth of anything (when that anything is by this demonstration located in the past).
The bottom line is that truth conditions are irrelevant to how we go about negotiating the world.  We just assume we are right.  After all, why would I waste my time thinking things that were wrong?  
One more example, this one from memory.  Sevewral weeeks ago in a discussion, Jason made the point that even pointing to things in the world could be false.  He demonstrated his point by pointing with his index finger and saying "He is a great philosopher" or something to that effect.  He was pointing to Joe's head, Joe being a philosophy grad student.  As Jason continued, it became apparent he was not referring to Joe, so I extrapolated Jason's physical pointing past Jason's field of vision to another male philosophy grad student sitting in the back of the room.  It seemed odd that he would be poiunting to someone out of his field of vision, but I continued to listen to his demonstration of falsity in pointing.  At this point Joe moved his head, and I became aware for the first timne that Jason was actually pointing to a notebook or clipboard he was holding in his other hand.  Now I knew what he was pointing to--a non-philosopher (it being a notebook or clipboard), demonstrating through his pointing the truth of his claim that verbally and physically pointing to something in the world can be false.  Only upon reflection and in hindsight is it possible to engage with his intended issue of falsity.  The matter had to be continually processed as true in order to even be understood.  What is the notion of truth in the present if it is no more than a constant holder of a continuously variable contents.  Without falsity, truth claims aboiut sentences, propositions statementsa or whatever become platonic entities, engaging with nothing.  
Truth has no bearing on semantics except as an imposition in hindsight.  Of course, this is a totally emic take on the issue--others can operate on assumptions that I know to be false.  For example, Jason could know that what I am saying is false, and of course, I know that his point about indexing the world is false, and so on (Why would either of us hold false beliefs?  Surely not from ignorance, because if that were the case, we would not know.  Can something one does not know be false?)  The bearing of truth upon semantics comes from projecting it upon an objective world.  This consists, in all cases and all times, as a hubristic assertion that one's own present is in fact true and can be universalized.  But the fact of the matter is that no one operates in the world etically.  All "objective" constructs suffer from this basic lack of traction, hence Hume's points on the limits of empiricism.  This is no reason to "go subjective" nor is it a reason to dismiss subjective matters as counterproductive or false in light f the practical value of projecting an objective world forone to operate in both socially and physically.  The point of skepticism is that there are limits here, and that boith positions can only be approached with incresing efforts and diminishing returns.  Why not then consider both, adopting an optimality approach and pushing the envelope rather than forever chasing one or the other limit.

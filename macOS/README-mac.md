Executing "1992PidCreole" should work on all systems but may have trouble on MacOS 10.15 and above. I only have an old mac running 10.14 so have not tested any of this.  If you have a Mac running MacOS 10.15 or newer, try "1992PidCreole_MacOS_10.15+" first.  If neither works, check the [DosBox-X support page](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/INSTALL.md#macos-packages-portable) for some fixes.  The 1992PidCreole app executable needs to be in this folder, wwhich it should be now, in order for the content to run, otherwise you will just get that most unhelpful of things, a DOS prompt.

I cannot offer any support on the Mac side, as I only have access to an ancient Mac sometimes.  If you really get stuck, explain things in a [github issue](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues) and they can probably get you sorted.
